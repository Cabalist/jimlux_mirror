<H2>Novel HV photos</H2>
<p>Here I am, standing in a Faraday cage (trusting in Gauss' law) with a couple
    of medium sized Tesla coils (Brian Basura's and Ross Overton's) zapping away
    on April 15th...</p>

<H2>Climbing and mountain top photos</H2>
<p>These are mostly climbing and summit photos, that I scanned and posted because
    someone asked about it. I can't say that I truly enjoy hard core rock climbing;
    I think you have to like pain for that. For me, it is a way to get to the top.
    The artistry of a fine climb isn't as much a motivator for me as getting to
    the top. On a good day, I can climb 5.7, 5.8, which was doing fairly well back
    in the '70's, but these days is a walkup.</p>

<p> Climbing is an activity more suited to the young and single without other
    time committments.I was spoiled in that I learned to climb in Tuolumne Meadows
    (in Yosemite) on nice clean granite. The local climbing in Los Angeles is on
    grimy gritty sandstone, with copious bird droppings, bees, dust, broken glass,
    and all around grunge. Of course, now that I have a nice clean climbing wall
    in my backyard, maybe I'll get a bit of practice. </p>
<p> I am unconcerned enough about it that I still climb in a pair of &quot;EB&quot;'s
    from 1976 (you can see that I don't climb enough to wear the gear out). And,
    when I show up at the local crags (like Stoney Point or Pt Dume), other climbers
    are shocked at my ancient gear: I have a veritable museum collection of Chouinard
    Hexes, old straight carabiners, etc. I don't think they'd be more surprised
    if I pulled out a hammer and some Lost Arrow pitons, but I started climbing
    just as &quot;clean climbing&quot; was becoming fashionable. </p>
