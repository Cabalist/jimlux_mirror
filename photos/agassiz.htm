            <p>Top of Mt Agassiz (near Bishop Pass), August 1987, 4235m (13,892 ft)<br>
                L->R: Dave Untrauer, Jim Lux, John Vafiades, Pete Seemsen<br>
                view looks roughly southwest over Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Park.
                The hike up is sort of a slog from Bishop Pass(12,000 ft), with some Class
                2 boulder scrambling to the top. We came down via a couloir to the southwest
                which empties (eventually) into Dusy Basin, where we had camped.</p>
