            This was the 2nd snowstorm of the season, so the view wasn't very spectacular
            here. The view from Trail Crest, on the other hand, was..We did the usual
            2 day trip up the trail, Whitney Portal to Trail Camp the first day, leave
            packs at TC, summit and back down on the second day. This trip was notable
            for me because I injured my knee about a mile away from the cars on the
            way back down, and couldn't walk for several days afterwards.
