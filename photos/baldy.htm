            <p>Top of Mt Baldy (aka Mt San Antonio), Februay 90(?) ca. 3500m (ca 10,000
                ft) <br>
                L->R: John Vafiades, Jim Lux<br>
                John's standing on the summit sign. Looking south west. All of Los Angeles
                was covered by low rainy stratus overcast. We thought it would be truly
                miserable hiking up, but we hiked up out of the fog and it was spectacular.
                Usual easy route up the ski lift, to Baldy Notch, then across the Devil's
                Backbone (which had deep soft snow which was a lot of work to cross).
                Glad I had the double boots this time.. Snow shoes or skis would have
                been nice. There was someone else up there, who took the picture for us,
                since there isn't anything to set a camera on for self timing.</p>
