<p>First Aid Kit contents</p>
<ul>
    <li>Band Aids of various sizes (long skinny ones and short fat ones)</li>
    <li>3x3 and 4x4 Telfa gauze pads</li>
    <li>Waterproof cloth tape 1&quot; wide - It works for fixing tears in clothing, tents, and sleeping bags,
        as well as taping bandages.
    </li>
    <li>Scalpel blades or single edge razor blades - Nothing like them for cutting out big splinters,
        removing blisters, etc. Scalpel blades come in nice sterile wrappers.
    </li>
    <li>Tweezers (if not on your knife)</li>
    <li>Small bottle of betadine - for cleaning wounds (put this in a plastic bag, it stains!!)</li>
    <li>Tylenol</li>
    <li>Needle &amp; Thread - mostly for repairing gear</li>
    <li>Benadryl capsules - antihistimine to suppress allergic reactions (i.e. hay fever) and as
        soporific
    </li>
    <li>Maalox tablets</li>
    <li>Alcohol swabs with Lidocaine - the Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic which takes a lot of the
        hurt out of abrasions and the like.
    </li>
    <li>Hemostat - works real well for pulling those Cholla spines through the side of your boot (or,
        God forbid, out of your skin). The needle nose pliers on a Leatherman makes a good
        substitute.
    </li>
    <li>Moleskin - absolutely essential</li>
    <li>Fever Thermometer (on multi day trips)</li>
    <li>Safety pins - although tape usually works better in a lot of cases, the pins are handy for some
        things, such as repairing clothing.
    </li>
    <li>Dishwashing soap in a little bottle. It cuts grease really well.</li>
    <li>Instruction card with first aid info and stuff like Ground/Air signals. It's better to read it than
        rely on your memory in a stressful situation.
    </li>
    <li>Water purification - I use a small bottle with water and crystalline iodine (Kahn Visscher
        technique).
    </li>
    <li>Piece of 1/4&quot; hardware cloth about 6&quot; x 24&quot; for use as a splint or brace. Tape the edges with
        duct tape or waterproof cloth tape so it doesn't snag stuff.
    </li>
    <li>Super glue - A small tube can perform miracles. Just watch out when fixing broken eyeglass
        frames to let the fumes dissipate or your eyes will water something fierce.
    </li>
</ul>
