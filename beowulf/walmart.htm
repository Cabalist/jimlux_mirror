<h2>A Beowulf from Walmart?</h2>
<p>Truly, this<i> is</i> supercomputing for the masses. Walmart sells everything
    you need to build a cluster.</p>
<p>Start with their $199 computer, which gets you a 10GB disk, a 10/100 network
    interface, and a CD-ROM drive, and a 600 MHz Via C3 processor. Linux is already
    installed. Only 128MB of RAM, and Walmart's RAM is a bit pricey ($118 for 512MB)...Spend
    a bit more and get a P4 or AMD processor</p>
<p>They sell a variety of FastE switches, from Linksys or Netgear.</p>
<p>You'd probably need at least 1 monitor, and then, you'd need one additional
    network card for the head node.</p>
<p>They have the plug strips (Belkin SurgeMaster, for instance, at $14.97)</p>
<p>A shelf to pile everything on... They've got Baker's racks for $67.77 and 3
    Tier Wire Cart (with a cutting board!) for $29.82</p>
<p>Cat 5 cables ranging from14-25 ft ($7.96, $7.97)</p>
<p>It's possible the Walmart motherboards support LinuxBios http://www.acl.lanl.gov/linuxbios/index.html</p>
<p>The computers are actually made by Microtel Computer Systems http://www.microtelpc.com/
</p>
<p>Some of Microtel's computers use a CA810 motherboard, but the 200 unit is,
    quoting: The combination of the low power VIA C3 processor and 128MB SDRAM on
    a VIA Apollo PLE133 Chipset based motherboard...</p>
