<h2>Amateur Television (ATV)</h2>
<p>I'm not a real ATV fiend, but I have fooled around with it some. I have some 
  gear from P.C. Electronics (<a href="http://www.hamtv.com/" target="_blank">http://www.hamtv.com/</a>) 
  that I got to put into a R/C sailplane. I have a 70 cm (440 MHz band) transmitter, 
  a 70 cm to Ch3 downconverter, and a little Ch3 to video demodulator.</p>
<p>TXA5-70b is a 100 mW transmitter, which I've got set up to switch between 426.25 
  and 434 MHz</p>
<p>TVC-2G is the down converter</p>
<h3>The Sailplane</h3>
<p>One of my first ATV experiments was I mounted an old CCD color camera, the 
  transmitter, and an antenna on a 2m wingspan sailplane. I've got a <a href="atvplane.htm">page</a> 
  with some pictures of the installation and more description. While interesting, 
  the overall experience was not all that successful. From a flying standpoint, 
  the rig was too heavy. From an ATV standpoint, the linear polarized transmission 
  and a vertical antenna only a meter or so off the ground had huge multipath 
  fades.</p>
<p>Now, I am convinced that circular polarization (CP) is the way to go (that, 
  and a bit of antenna gain and height so the receiver antenna isn't so close 
  to the ground). A az/el (or even just an az) controlled Yagi or Log periodic 
  might be a good way too. For the sailplane version, this would work pretty well, 
  since a beamwidth of 40-60 degrees would nicely cover the entire airspace where 
  the plane would be flying. The Clear Lake Amateur Radio Club has a <a href="http://www.clarc.org/Articles/uhf.htm" target="_blank">web 
  page</a> with cheap easy to build medium gain Yagi antennas. I've actually built 
  an <a href="antenna/beam70cm.htm">70 cm beam antenna</a> based on their designs.</p>
<p>However, for ground based sources (my current interest, see the <a href="http://www.luxfamily.com/jimlux/robot/index.htm">robot 
  pages</a>) gain antennas are pretty tricky. The mobile would need to steer the 
  antenna, and multipath is going to be a problem when you are sitting less than 
  a wavelength or so off the ground. So, hence my interest in omnidirectional 
  (in horizontal plane) antennas like the Lindenblad, the Superturnstile, etc. 
  Check out the <a href="antenna/bucket1.htm">bucket Lindenblad</a>. For a more 
  crude version, being used for testing, there is the <a href="antenna/bucketwhip.htm">bucketwhip</a>.... 
  A 1/4 ground plane vertical. </p>
<h3>Packaging the TVC-2G</h3>
<p>Another learning experience with the plane was that a cardboard box with a 
  bunch of stuff in it doesn't make for a good field installation. So, I finally 
  decided to put the TVC-2G into a box so that it doesn't get banged up. A plastic 
  box (metal would be nicer, and I suppose I could coat the inside of the box 
  with copper or aluminum foil) holds 8 AAA batteries for a 12V supply, as well 
  as the TVC-2G. The input is on a BNC, the output on a standard cable TV type 
  &quot;F&quot; connector. I've noticed a few spurious signal problems with the 
  TVC-2G (that is, touching it detunes it), but inside the box, it seems to work 
  ok.</p>
<p>I either run the output to a TV tuned to Channel 3 (using cable) or I couple 
  it to a short whip, which then radiates to the whip of a small LCD TV stuck 
  to the box with Velcro. </p>
<h3>LCD TV</h3>
<p>When testing it on the bench with the 426.25 transmitter, I noticed an odd 
  thing. The LCD TV will tune the 426.25 signal on the &quot;UHF&quot; position, 
  which is odd, since UHF channels start at 470 MHz, and it tunes a ways up in 
  the band. It's probably an image in the TV receiver. A typical TV IF is 45.75 
  MHz, so there's an image 91.5 MHz away, or, at around 516 MHz apparent frequency. 
  This is a strong signal case (100 mW into a quarter wave ground plane about 
  1-2 meters away from the receiver). Typical UHF receiver noise figure is 10-12 
  dB, a lot worse than the 2 or 3 dB from the TVC-2G.</p>
<p>With a bit of web research, I think I found that this unit (a Radio Shack/RCA 
  160-3050) is really a Casio TV-880. Thanks to &quot;<a href="http://www.guenthoer.de/farbe2.htm" target="_blank">Frank's 
  Taschenfernsehere: Bunt und Billig (Teil 2)</a>&quot; where he had a similar 
  looking unit (the TV770, for PAL) and a link to a pdf service manual (at a site 
  called www.guenthoer.de/doku/) At that site, I found the <a href="http://www.guenthoer.de/doku/service-casiotv880.pdf" target="_blank">TV-880 
  service manua</a>l, which comparing the parts list to the Radio Shack parts 
  list, is virtually identical (right down to package codes on ICs). [ I just 
  found Frank's English language pages: http://www.guenthoer.de/index-e.htm. Thanks 
  again, Frank (Frank Günthör) ]</p>
