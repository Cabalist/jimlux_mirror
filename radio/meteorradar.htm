<h2>Multi-channel Meteor Radar</h2>
<p>I got the idea from a few meteor radar sites when I got a message from SpaceWatch
    about the Perseid shower in early August ( and ). Basically, these are pretty
    simple; an antenna pointed straight up with an SSB receiver tuned to an over
    the horizon TV station.Here's a couple of links: </p>

<p> I wanted a multi channel radar, though, so I could do some crude direction
    finding, or, at least, listen to the meteors in stereo. Without actually building
    multiple phase matched receivers (or modifying receivers to feed them from a
    common LO), I figured out one way to do it. The first idea was that the recording
    didn't have to be phase matched, as long as I could recover the phase later.
    I could inject a tone in the receivers' passbands from an external oscillator,
    track that tone and back the phase shift out. The oscillator didn't need to
    be all that hot stuff, just reasonably stable, and radiating a very low power,
    somewhere near the antennas. Here's a diagram illustrating it:</p>

<p>The next problem was that SSB receivers for 60 MHz aren't cheap. Some of the
    medium priced shortwave radios will work in SSB in the low VHF band, but not
    many. The Icom PCR1000 computerized receiver will do it, but will set you back
    $300+, and I wanted multiple channels, and wasn't willing to pay thousands of
    dollars to do it.</p>
<p>Sitting around contemplating a design for a CW FM radar in Xband, I hit on
    the idea that the difference between an AM and a SSB radio is that the SSB radio
    generally has narrower bandwidth (only one sideband) and that it reinjects the
    carrier (a BFO, in old CW receiver parlance). The narrow bandwidth wasn't something
    I particularly wanted, the 5kHz or so for the AM radio is just fine, and I could
    inject my own BFO, which would be much like the pilot tone in the previous scheme.
    All I'd be using the AM radio for is as a IF strip and detector (yes, there
    are some issues with images, and the like). And, of course, the previous problem
    with tuning the VHF band is still there.</p>
<p>So, the new scheme is this. Feed the antenna to a mixer, where I feed a common
    LO to mix it down to a convenient frequency for the next stage (I haven't decided
    yet... 1MHz is in the middle of the AM band, but a shortwave receiver might
    be a better way). Inject a BFO at almost the same frequency, and feed it to
    the receiver. Actually, since there aren't any filters in the front end, you
    can inject the pilot in the same way. I've also added a LNA of some sort (probably
    one of those TV booster amps would do) to overcome the loss through the mixer.
    Here's a diagram of this scheme:</p>

<p>Now, all I have to do is find a suitable IF strip.. that is, a cheap SW receiver
    with suitable bandwidth (wider the better, in this case). I wonder how stable
    the tuning is for the &quot;slide rule&quot; tuned units? I assume they use
    an LC circuit, but once you set it up, it's probably pretty stable, although,
    the intention is to set something like this up and leave it for extended periods
    of time (like overnight), so if it drifts too much, you'll lose the carrier
    from the TV station that you're using as your bistatic transmitter.. The direct
    entry PLL varieties are also widely available.. this weekend (24 August 2002)
    Radio Shack was blowing some of them them out for $30 a piece, but you're beholden
    to the XO in them, which is probably only good to 100 ppm, on a good day. </p>
<p>The LO can probably be one of those TTL clock oscillators, with a rudimentary
    filter on the output. OTOH, I'm going to be driving a saturated mixer, so a
    square wave probably isn't all that bad. They're readily available at 40 and
    50 MHz. A capacitor will couple it to the mixer. The mixer can be any of a variety
    of cheap mixers; Mini-Circuits to the rescue. The reference oscillator's a bit
    more of a challenge. Maybe one of those channel 3/4 video modulators? Pick the
    LO frequency so that a harmonic is in band? Here's a case where spurs are your
    friend. </p>
<p>It also occurs to me that this same technique would work to build an interferometric
    radio telescope.</p>
