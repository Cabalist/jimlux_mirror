<h2>Linx Technologies Modules, Boards, and Modifications</h2>
<p>I have a set of the <a href="http://www.linxtechnologies.com/" target="_blank">Linx
    Technologies</a> 900 MHz band modules intended for Part 15 use, and the evaluation
    boards on which to test them. In fact, I think you can't buy just one or two
    of the modules by themselves, since the mfr is aiming at mass sales, and wants
    to restrict sales to folks who might operate them illegally. These are very
    useful modules, and work great.</p>
<p>For Part 15 use, removable antennas have to use a connector not generally available,
    so the Linx eval modules use reverse polarity SMA connectors (that is, the male
    thread is the male connector). Personally, I don't think that an SMA connector
    is generally any more available than the funky RP one, since firms like Pasternak
    sell the RP SMAs, as well as the RP TNCs and other connectors that the Part15
    supply world is fond of.</p>
<p>Anyway, I modified one of the Linx boards to use standard polarity SMAs. This
    involves sacrificing the RP SMAs currently soldered in (I couldn't get all the
    solder off all 5 pins at the same time) by cutting the connector up with a pair
    of big cutters, then removing the pieces one by one. Now I can connect the modules
    to another antenna, like the <a href="antenna/helix900.htm">900 MHz helices</a>.</p>
<p>I modified the boards further to run the RTS line from the RS232 interface
    chip (MAX232) to the Tx power down (PwrDn*) control, allowing the host device
    to control the half duplex comms. It turns out (of course) that the sense of
    the signal is wrong, so an NPN transistor serves as an inverter between the
    MAX232 and the Tx module.</p>
<p>For use in the ham bands, you have to identify your transmitter periodically.
    It's not real clear what the minimum requirement is, especially for a data link,
    using some homegrown comm protocol. One reference says you can ID in ASCII,
    but I decided to take the easy way, and ID with Morse Code by just keying the
    Tx on and off using the power down line, nominally connected to the RTS line.
    (It's also how I ID the video carrier...)</p>

<p>900 MHz Band Plan</p>
<p>If one is using the Linx modules as an amateur, particularly if you are running
    more power or a gain antenna, you should really be aware of the nominal 33 cm
    Band Plan. The following diagram shows the ARRL approved Band Plan (which doesn't
    have the force of law or regulation, but still is a good thing to follow) compared
    with the Linx module channels. It looks like Channel 0 and Channel 5 are appropriate
    for use.</p>
