<h2>RS-232 Interface to Passive Phased Array Controller</h2>
<p>A single RS232 port is used to control all the modified LDG QRP antenna tuners.
    A <a href="http://ww.maxim-ic.com/">Maxim</a> MAX208 RS-232 Transceiver chip
    is used for level shifting. This chip generates all the necessary bipolar power
    needed from the +5V system power. </p>
<p>The TxD and RxD lines from the 68HC11 processors are all tied together. The
    TxD lines are configured (by default) as open drain, so they can share, providing
    that the processors don't all try to talk at once. A 5K resistor provides the
    pull up for the shared line.The original 1K pull up on the LDG board is disabled
    by cutting the trace, otherwise, a single 68HC11 would have to pull down all
    10 pullups: 100 ohms or 50 mA!</p>
<p>The Reset* and XIRQ* lines are all active low, with pull ups on the LDG board,
    so an open collector driver using a discrete NPN transistor is driven from the
    outputs of the RS232 buffers for DTR and RTS respectively. This transistor does
    need to sink 50 mA, supplied by all the LDG boards together. The 1K base resistor
    will provide 3-4 mA of drive to the transistor, which should be sufficient to
    saturate it, no matter what sort of transistor is used. (I'm using 2N3904's)
</p>
<p>The 12V power is regulated to 5V for use by the Maxim chip, and as a reference
    against the pullups.</p>
<p>The schematic below does not show all the capacitors needed by the MAX208 and
    filter devices. I also will probably add some LED's to monitor the levels for
    convenience. </p>
