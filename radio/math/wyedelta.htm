    <A NAME="pit"></A>Transforming from Pi to T and vice versa</H4>
Any pi network can be transformed to an equivalent T network. This is also
known as the Wye-Delta transformation, which is the terminology used in
power distribution and electrical engineering. The pi is equivalent to
the Delta and the T is equivalent to the Wye (or Star) form.

<P>The impedances of the pi network (Za, Zb, and Zc) can be found from
    the impedances of the T network with the following equations:

<P>Za =&nbsp; (&nbsp; (Z1*Z2)+(Z1*Z3)+(Z2*Z3) ) / Z2
    <BR>Zb&nbsp; = (&nbsp; (Z1*Z2)+(Z1*Z3)+(Z2*Z3) ) / Z1
    <BR>Zc =&nbsp; (&nbsp; (Z1*Z2)+(Z1*Z3)+(Z2*Z3) ) / Z3

<P>Note the common numerator in all these expressions which can prove useful
    in reducing the amount of computation necessary.

<P>The impedances of the T network (Z1, Z2, Z3) can be found from the impedances
    of the equivalent pi network with the following equations:

<P>Z1 =&nbsp; (Za * Zc) / (Za + Zb + Zc) <BR>
    Z2 =&nbsp; (Zb * Zc) / (Za + Zb + Zc) <BR>
    Z3 =&nbsp; (Za * Zb) / (Za + Zb + Zc)

<P>Note the common denominator in these expressions.

<P>In the case where all the impedances are reactive (i.e. they are all
    in the form jX), it is handy to note that the -1 factors from squaring
    j*j on the top cancels the -1 from bringing the j in the denominator up
    top.

    <A NAME="synth"></A>Synthesis of pi and T networks to transform resistances
    and create phase shifts</H4>
Assuming that the desired port impedances are purely resistive (i.e. real),
you can design a T or pi network with purely reactive components both to
produce a desired phase shift (beta) and transform the impedances with
the following equations. Note that beta can be any value, except for zero
or pi.

<P>Z1 = -j * (R1 *cos(beta) - sqrt( R1 * R2))/ sin (beta)
    <BR>Z2 = -j * (R2 *cos(beta) - sqrt(R1 * R2))/sin(beta)
    <BR>Z3 = -j * sqrt(R1*R2) / sin(beta)

<P>Za = j *R1*R2 * sin(beta) / (R2 * cos(beta) - sqrt(R1 * R2))
    <BR>Zb = j * R1*R2 * sin(beta) / (R1 * cos(beta) - sqrt(R1 * R2))
    <BR>Zc = j * sqrt( R1 * R2) * sin (beta)

<P>Beta is the phase lag passing through the network from either port 1
    to port 2 or vice versa. Note that if beta is 0 or pi, these expressions
    break down, except if R1=R2. If you need to transform resistive impedances
    and you don't want any phase shift, you have to use a transformer.

<P>In many practical applications, the load or generator impedances may
    be reactive (i.e. Z (port 1) and Z (port 2) are some general R+jX). This
    can be accomodated by absorbing the external reactive impedance into the
    network, reducing or increasing the series or shunt impedance as requred.
    For instance, if a T network is required to connect between two impedances:
    50+j0 and 100-j20 with 45 degrees of phase shift:

<P>First, calculate the Z's assuming resistive impedances: R1=50, R2= 100

<P>Z1 = -j * (50 * .707 - sqrt(50*100))/.707 = +j 50 ohms
    <BR>Z2 = -j * (100 * .707 - sqrt(50*100))/.707 = 0 ohms
    <BR>Z3 = -j * sqrt( 50 * 100) / .707 = -j 100 ohms

<P>(the example is somewhat contrived, and it winds up creating an L network
    for the resistive case).

<P>Now, a reactive component is added to Z2 to exactly cancel the external
    reactive component. This changes Z2 from 0 ohms to +j20 ohms. The final
    network is then:

<P>Z1 = +j50, Z2= +j20, Z3 = -j100 ohms

<P>If you are working with a pi network, you would want to transform the
    external impedances into their corresponding shunt forms first, so that
    the reactive component is a shunt value, which would be absorbed (or combined)
    with the corresponding shunt component of the pi network.
