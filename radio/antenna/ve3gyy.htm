<h2>A broadside array for 10 meters - VE3GYY</h2>
<p>Peter Wotherspoon, VE3GYY, suggested an array consisting of 9 vertical wire
    dipoles spaced 1/4 wavelength apart, fed in phase to produce a broadside pattern.
    His original idea was for a feed network consisting of equal lengths of 300
    ohm twinlead, grouped in threes:</p>

<p>Peter didn't propose any particular length of feeders, and, as is discussed
    elswhere, this scheme won't necessarily accomplish the goal of feeding all the
    elements in phase, mostly because of the mutual impedances between the elements.
    It seemed a good exercise to figure out what those impedances actually are.
    NEC can make short work of this sort of problem, or, one could use an approximation
    for the mutual impedance between halfwave resonant dipoles, values for which
    are tabulated in a variety of places.</p>
<p> I started by building a NEC model of the dipoles. I made them all 5 meters
    long, and running the model at 30 MHz. In actuality, these dipoles would be
    a bit &quot;long&quot;, but, since I was interested in finding out the mutual
    effects, and more importantly, whether the earth had any signficant effect.
    I did this by running the model in free space, with perfect earth, and with
    real earth (but not the Sommerfield Norton ground model, which I really should
    do, because these really are near field effects...). I ran it 3 times, with
    the center of the array 3 meters, 4 meters, and 5 meters off the ground (since
    the &quot;arm&quot; of the dipole is only 2.5 m long, this corresponds to the
    lower end of the dipole being 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 meters off the ground). The
    elements were spaced an eighth wavelength (i.e. 1.25 meters) apart. </p>
<p>The mutual impedances were measured by exciting one of the elements, and connecting
    a 10K resistor across the feeds of the other 8 elements. A bit of complex math
    in a spreadsheet results in the mutul Z numbers.</p>
<p>The NEC input files and the Excel analyses are here:</p>
<table width="75%" border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>3m</td>
        <td><a href="data/zvdat3.txt">input</a></td>
        <td><a href="data/zvdat3.xls">xls</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4m</td>
        <td><a href="data/zvdat4.txt">input</a></td>
        <td><a href="data/zvdat4.xls">xls</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5m</td>
        <td><a href="data/zvdat5.txt">input</a></td>
        <td><a href="data/zvdat5.xls">xls</a></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>This was interesting...</p>
<p>Now, I tried a feed network using 1/4 wave lines of 300 ohm twinlead, all tied
    to the same point. <a href="data/ve3gyya.txt">NEC Model file</a></p>
<p>The feed impedance isn't all that strange: 83.3+j26.9, 90.2+j25.6 (perfect
    ground), 86.1+j26.5(real ground, approx), and a quick check on the magnitudes
    and phases shows them all being about the same.</p>
