<p>Off Center Fed Inverted V Dipole</p>
<p>This was an investigation into whether an inverted V dipole, notionally cut 
  for 20m, could be fed offcenter to work on 20, 17, 15, 12, AND 10. The summary 
  is that you can find a spot where it will be reasonably resonant on 10 and 20 
  (i.e. two half waves or a single half wave), but the rest is impossible.</p>
<p>A NEC model file was built, and run using 4NEC2 to step through the possible 
  feed points. The dipole is modeled as 2 arms, each with 50 segments (so, about 
  10 cm/segment) and a bridging segment at the apex. Here's the model and a rendering 
  of the antenna, fed in the 20 m band, showing high current in the middle where 
  you would expect it.</p>

<p>I used the &quot;EVALUATE&quot; feature of the 4NEC2 optimizer to change the 
  feedpoint segment number within the wire on one side. 4NEC2 generates a file 
  called &quot;optimizer.log&quot;, which you can paste into an Excel spreadsheet 
  for later processing. A separate run is needed for each frequency, so I did 
  5 runs, at: 14.2, 18.110, 21.3, 24.93, and 28.3 MHz. Here are some results plotted, 
  first, the magnitude of the feed point impedance as a function of the feed point 
  position.</p>

<p> I also used Excel to calculate the SWR, plotting that, then fooled with changing 
  the assumed source impedance. Here's a plot of the VSWR with a 250 ohm (resistive) 
  source. You can see that the match on 10 and 10 isn't all that bad, but you 
  can't even see the match for the other bands.</p>
