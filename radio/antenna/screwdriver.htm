<h2>Screwdriver Antennas</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Generically, the screwdriver antenna is a vertical with a tuning/loading coil
    adjuted by a cordless screwdriver. The bottom of the antenna is a piece of tubing
    big enough to cover the motor, the top is a straight whip. There are a bunch
    of firms selling plans or antennas, a search for &quot;screwdriver antenna&quot;
    will turn them up. You'll also see this referred to as the DK3 antenna or the
    W6AAQ </p>
<h3>My Antenna</h3>
<p>My screwdriver antenna is a BBC3 from Nott Ltd, purchased from Ham Radio Outlet.
    I don't claim that it's the best deal, the best constructed, etc., just that
    it was in stock when the &quot;bug bit&quot;. There's a bit of detail on how
    I mounted it on my <a href="../mobile.htm">mobile rig page</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a link to an article by Ron Nott: <a href="http://www.antennex.com/preview/Folder01/screwdrv/screwdrv.htm">
    http://www.antennex.com/preview/Folder01/screwdrv/screwdrv.htm</a></p>
<p>I've also rigged up a <a href="tripod.htm">tripod</a> of collapsible painter's
    poles to support the antenna for field operations.</p>
<h3>Some Measurements</h3>
<p>Now that the antenna is installed, I've made some preliminary measurements
    on it. Overall comment: Tuning is very sharp on lower frequencies (but I knew
    that going in, what do you expect from a short radiator and tuning coil)</p>
<p>A comment from Nott's writeup in Antennex: Whip length also gets into the impedance
    matching act as it provides the top loading which reflects back to the antenna
    input. For 80 meters, a 96 or 102 inch (2.4 or 2.6 m) whip works best in most
    applications. From 20 meters up, a whip as short as 63" (1.6 m) works quite
    well and still allows operation in the upper end of the 75 meter band. </p>
<p>This doesn't really reflect what I've found. A short whip (on the order of
    the 63&quot; mentioned) doesn't really tune 75 meters, and it's very, very touchy
    on 40. 10 doesn't tune so well, either, but 20, 17, and 15 work fine</p>
<p> I have to say, based on some measurements made in the lab, that the turns
    ratio probably is around 2:1 (4:1 Z).. but still, with a radiation resistance
    of 1-2 ohms, that's only 8 ohms into the feedline. You really need something
    like a 4:1 transformer (16:1 Z)</p>
<p>For a 9 foot (2.74 m) total length, assuming it's a monopole (i.e. really like
    a 18 foot short dipole), the radiation resistance (using 20* (2pi/lambda)^2
    * h^2 ) is as follows: (ignore the spurious accuracy.. )</p>

<h3>The matching box</h3>
<p>I made some measurements on the matching box with a high impedance load and
    into a 50 ohm load. A HP3325 was the source and a dual channel oscilloscope
    was used to measure the input and output voltages. About 1 meter of RG58 coax
    on the feed side, another meter on the load side. The data is in an Excel Spreadsheet
    (<a href="data/screw1.xls">screw1.xls - 24 kB</a>) It appears that the turns
    ratio is 2:1. At low frequencies thats the voltage ratio from input to output.
    With the 50 ohm load, the effective ratio changes from 1:0.6 (at 1MHz) to 1:0.3
    (at 20 MHz), which tracks fairly well with the apparent load impedance (the
    50 ohm load reflected to the primary side by (turns ratio)^2).</p>
<p>I've also popped the lid off, and it is, in fact a toroidal core with a bifilar
    winding. There's no capacitor from input to output, which I've seen on some
    other matching networks proposed for these sorts of things.</p>

    A matching transformer
    using 75 ohm coax.. 68 inches at .66 vel factor = 103 inches free space.. 2.62
    meters. That's around 1/4 wavelength for 10 meter band, but nowhere near that
    for 40 meters, etc. However, it does provide some impedance transformation,
    and the reactive component could be cancelled by the coil in the antenna.</p>

    - A page showing the DK-3, with an interesting variation on the feed network
    instead of the toroidal transformer (incorrectly spelled <i>torrid</i>, as in
    blazing hot, on this website...). It shows an inductor at the bottom, but it's
    not real clear how the inductor is made, but it's referred to as a Z match.</p>

    http://home.gwi.net/~brandall/mara/squelch/jan00.pdf</a> has an article on page
    3 describing another matching network technique: a relay to switch between toroidal
    transformer (good for the lower frequencies where the R is very low) and a shunt
    C for the higher bands. The article is by W5ES, and here's another link from
    him: <a href="http://www.qsl.net/w5es/installations.htm">

    No construction details given (obviously, the site owner wants to sell the units,
    so this is reasonable). Note that this site has annoying (to me) musical background.</p>

    gives some specs for their particular
    antenna, the form factor of which is somewhat different (and the length doesn't
    change, being a constant 9 ft). Note particularly the SWR bandwidth, and the
    kind and length of coax (yep, 42 ft of RG-8X is a nontrivial feedline...), and
    the fact that they're operating it 18&quot; off the ground (I wonder if they
    had a stake in the ground?)</p>
<p><cite>SPECIFICATIONS: <br>
    FREQUENCY ---------- S.W.R ------------ 2:1 BANDWIDTH<br>
    3.660 MHz -------------- 1.05:1 ------------- 50 kHz<br>
    3.890 MHz -------------- 1.1:1 -------------- 46 KHz<br>
    7.220 MHz -------------- 1.35:1--------------100 KHz<br>

    GENERAL BANDHOPPER MEASUREMENTS The above measurements were made in 1993 using
    a Kenwood TS-940S transceiver with the BANDHOPPER antenna mounted 18" above
    ground through 42 feet of RG-8X coax. Your measurements may vary depending upon
    your particular mounting configuration and how close the coil portion is to
    near by metal surfaces.</cite></p>
<p>They also have a relay box that switches in 100, 390 or 1000 pF (for 20,40,
    and 80) in parallel with the feedline, close to the feedpoint with a coax &quot;T&quot;.
    Another control box uses 50, 390 and 1000, switched a bit differently. I kind
    of like their control box designs, they put the relay which run the antenna
    motor and switch the tuning components, etc near the antenna, and have a remote
    switch box to run the relays.</p>
