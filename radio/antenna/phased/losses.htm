<h2>Losses (ground and otherwise) </h2>
<p>One of the reasons for considering a phased array, whether it be all driven
    or partially parasitic elements, is that it can reduce the ground losses. In
    a simplistic analysis, which would work for patterns, you can just independently
    sum up the far field responses for each element, scaled as appropriate by the
    element current. After all, there's no nonlinearities, so it's linear and superposition
    works.</p>
<p>However, when you start to consider loss effects, it's not quite so simple.
    A single dipole might have substantial ground loss, yet an array, with the same
    total power spread among them, have less. Why is this? Why isn't the loss the
    same as the individual element losses?</p>
<p>Consider a small chunk of the (lossy) ground under the antenna. The amount
    of energy dissipated (lost) in this chunk is proportional to (the square of)
    the current through (I^2*R) or voltage across the chunk. If the fields from
    multiple elements combine to reduce that total current or voltage, then the
    dissipation is less. It gets to be a lot less real fast, because dissipation
    goes as the square of the induced current: cutting the field in half cuts the
    dissipation by a factor of 4.</p>
<p>In practical terms, if I started with an isotropic radiator, and now I have
    an antenna with 10 dB of gain in the horizontal plane, I've reduced the amount
    of power I'm beaming at the ground. It's not quite that simple, because most
    likely you're in the near field, and highly directive antennas tend to have
    very high fields within the near field. Recall that in the near field, by definition,
    energy is being stored in the fields around the antenna, flowing between antenna
    and field on every cycle. One can even think of it in terms of a resonant cavity
    with a &quot;Q&quot;, in that in each cycle, energy at the feedpoint is dumped
    into the cavity, and some amount is radiated away, and some larger amount is
    just &quot;circulating&quot; back and forth.</p>
