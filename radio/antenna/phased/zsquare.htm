<h2>Mutual Z in a square array</h2>
<p>The &quot;four-square&quot; array of vertical antennas has been around a long
    while in various forms. The idea is to put 4 vertical antennas in a square with
    sides that are 1/4 wavelength, 3/8 wavelength, etc.. The array is symmetrical,
    and a fairly simple feed scheme (feed 2 in phase, and 2 lagging by 90 or 135
    degrees) and some relays can be used to form a beam that can be rotated to 4
    (or 8) positions. Given that the beamwidth is on the order of 90 degrees, this
    works fairly well. The moderately large aperture also means that not too much
    power is being radiated at high angles.</p>
<p>This page gives some mutual impedances calculated for an array in free space
    using NEC2.</p>
<h3>Historical notes</h3>
<p>It seems to be quite popular for 160m, where the reasonable aperture with small
    radiators, and the ability to point away from noise is probably the selling
    point. The ARRL handbook had a 40 meter version using a Wilkinson power divider
    for a number of years. Unfortunately, that design didn't allow for the mutual
    Z of the elements, and didn't perform particularly well, a topic discussed at
    some length in the ARRL Antenna Book. Subsequently, the Antenna Compendium has
    had a number of versions, including some with center loaded sleeve dipoles,
    various schemes using sloping dipoles off a tower, and so forth.</p>
<p>I've often thought about building a small monopole array for use at 2m and
    70cm by putting 4 antennas on the roof of the car, and using a suitable rotary
    switch to move the beam. The extra 5-6 dB or so from the array gain would help
    hit those distant repeaters. On the other hand, a 40 Watt amplifier might work
    just as well, and is omnidirectional.</p>
<h3>Modelling results</h3>
<p>Some NEC studies were done to determine the mutual Z for a square array. Two
    cases were run with the square sides 1/4 wavelength and 3/8 wavelength. (At
    1/2 wavelength, you don't form a unidirectional beam). In both cases, the length
    of the dipoles were adjusted to make the driven element &quot;resonant&quot;,
    or at least, with a reactive impedance less than an ohm.</p>
<p>The 4 elements are numbered as follows:</p>
<table width="25%" border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <div align="center">2</div>
        </td>
        <td>
            <div align="center">4</div>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <div align="center">1</div>
        </td>
        <td>
            <div align="center">3</div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>There is a lot of symmetry: Z12=Z13, Z14 = Z23, etc..</p>
<p>The model was run at 29.98 MHz with copper wires 0.00127 in diameter (approximately
    #10 AWG). The wavelength of 10.0 meters made spacing the elements easy, which
    is why it was chosen. Element 1 was driven, and the other elements were loaded
    with a 10K resistor. The voltages and currents from the NEC output were then
    used to calculate the mutual Z.</p>
<p>In the 1/4 wave case, the elements wound up being 4.83 meters long. In the
    3/8 wavelength spacing case, the elements were slightly shorter: 4.82 meters.
    The one cm difference manifested itself as a change in the reactive impedance
    of about 1 ohm. While the impedances in the following table are reported to
    0.01 ohm, I suspect that the real accuracy is somwhat poorer.</p>

            <p>Spacing<br>
                (wavelength) </p>
        </td>
        <td>Z11</td>
        <td>Z12</td>
        <td>Z13</td>
        <td>Z14</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1/4</td>
        <td>69.77-j0.87</td>
        <td>-36.16+j29.76</td>
        <td>-36.16+j29.76</td>
        <td>-11.35+j37.99</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3/8</td>
        <td>67.64+j0.82</td>
        <td>-9.98+j35.16</td>
        <td>-9.98+j35.16</td>
        <td>17.41+j22.45</td>
    </tr>

<p>Note that the &quot;resonant&quot; impedance is slightly different from the
    nominal 72 ohms you would expect for an ideal thin dipole. This is no doubt
    due to several factors: the finite size of the wires, the resistive loading,
    and the effect of the &quot;parasitic&quot; elements, even though they are effectively
    open circuited.</p>
<p>For 1/4 monopoles above a ground plane, divide these numbers by two.</p>
<p>The impedances will vary somewhat when operating above a real ground.</p>
