<h2>Mutual Impedance of two dipoles</h2>
<p>There are analytical solutions for this</p>
<h3>Numerical models</h3>
<p>A simple NEC 2 model was created of two dipoles in free space. The length of 
  the dipoles was adjusted to make one resonant, when the other was opencircuited 
  at the feed.</p>
<p>Here's the feedpoint impedance as the spacing is varied, with the second dipole 
  open. The thumbnails are small for fast loading. Click them for a much bigger 
  version (about 25kB)</p>

<p>Note that the second dipole, though open, does have an effect on the feed point 
  impedance of the first dipole. It kind of looks like as it moves far away, the 
  reactance is about 2 ohms. I set the length so the reactance would be zero at 
  0.05 spacing (which is quite close)</p>
<p>And, here's the feedpoint impedance with the other element feedpoint shorted:</p>

<p>The mutual impedance has a large effect at short distances, eventually going 
  away as you get farther away, as you would expect.</p>
<p>We can convert these open and shorted measurements to self and mutual impedances 
  by using some arithmetic manipulation.</p>
<p>Given:</p>
<p>Ro,Xo = Impedance with other element open<br>
  Rs,Xs = Impedance with other element shorted</p>
<p>We get:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some observations</p>
<p>Considering just the mutual impedance (i.e. the voltage induced in one element 
  by the current in another), and looking at the curves of the real and imaginary 
  components, it looks like maybe it's worth considering it in terms of magnitude 
  and phase. After all, from a conceptual standpoint, you'd expect the magnitude 
  to fall off as a functionof distance, and the phase to be somehow related to 
  the time delay for the EM to propagate from one element to the other. </p>
<p>In the &quot;far field&quot;, this would certainly be the case, and, in fact, 
  Carter, among others, derived some standard relationships for this. However, 
  in the near field, it's not so simple. I calculated the phase, and then fit 
  a straight line to the phase vs distance. The difference between the straight 
  line phase and the actual phase is shown in the figure below. The various traces 
  are for frequencies varying from the nominal. Once you get more than a wavelength 
  spacing (1.00) the residual settles down to a straight line, but in close, there's 
  quite a bit of error. I'm not sure what the wiggles in the 0 frequency offset 
  case are all about.</p>
