<h2>Models for mutual admittances</h2>
<p>Sometimes it's helpful to look at a picture of what all the mutual impedances/admittances
    are. The drawing below shows all the admittances. I haven't transformed it into
    an impedance lattice yet, but, just as an admittance pi network can be transformed
    to an impedance T network, one should be able to do so.</p>

<p>I find that most people have a better conceptual and practical feel for impedances
    (since that's what you see on the antenna analyzer and Smith chart) than for
    admittances. It's a lot more familiar to refer to 50 ohms, rather than 20 millisiemens.</p>
<p>Consider cases with two elements. With the Z matrix, [E] = [Z][I]. What this
    means is that the voltage at feedpoint 1 is a linear combination of the currents
    in elements 1..N. If there is no coupling then that entry in the Z matrix is
    zero.</p>
<p>Consider the Y matrix: [I]=[Y][E]. This gives the current in the element given
    the voltages at the feed points. Again, if there is no coupling then the corresponding
    term of the matrix is 0.</p>
<p>Note that in the diagram above, the mutual admittances do NOT, in general,
    correspond to that entry of the matrix. Consider, for example, the current flowing
    into #1, <i>i.e.</i> the first row of the Y matrix. It would be:<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace">I1 = E1*Y11 + (E1-E2)*Y12 + (E1-E3)*Y13 + (E1-E4)*Y14</span><br>
    or, after rearranging a bit:<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace">I1 = E1 * ( Y11+Y12+Y13+Y14) + E2 * (-Y12) + E3 * (-Y13) + E4 * (-Y14)</span></p>
