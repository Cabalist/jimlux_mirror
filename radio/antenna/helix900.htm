<h2>900 MHz Helical Antenna</h2>
<p>The evaluation kit for the Linx Technologies units (which work at 908-928 MHz)
    only comes with two antennas. There is no T/R switch on the evaluation boards,
    so some additional antennas will be necessary to try a full duplex (or, at least,
    half duplex) link. After casting about for ideas on what sort of antenna to
    build (other than just a 1/4 wave ground plane...), I decided to build a pair
    of helical antennas, one for each circular sense. Helical antennas have broad
    bandwidth, loose construction tolerances, and for 900 MHz, wouldn't be too big.
    They also have a bit of gain (10-14 dBi), so they'd be a nice choice for talking
    to the robot at a distance (10 dB would be about a factor of 3 range increase).</p>
<p>The basic design rules for helicals (in Kraus' book, or the ARRL antenna handbook)
    say that the circumference of the winding should be on the order of a wavelength
    (33 cm in this case). This works out to 10.5 cm, or about 4&quot;, a convenient
    size to wind. I found a 3&quot; PVC coupling that is 103 mm OD, which served
    as a nice form. I had some AWG 10 (or is it 6?) bare copper wire that I wound
    on the form. It springs back a bit after winding, so the resulting coil is 110mm
    in diameter, which is certainly in the right range. A typical winding pitch
    is a quarter of a wavelength per turn, or, in this case, about 8 cm/turn (3
    1/4 inches). I have 11 turns of the copper wire total, so if I split it into
    5.5 turns per antenna, I can have a left and right pair. The approximate axial
    ratio is 2n/(2n+1), so I should get an axial ratio around 0.9. To make the opposite
    sense, I will have to rewind the coil though (slightly...)</p>
<p> Actually, I foolishly thought the winding pitch was a quarter of the diameter
    at first (25 mm, 1 inch), and ran a bunch of NEC models at that pitch, and the
    gain is still reasonably good (9dBi), but the axial ratio wasn't that hot. </p>
<p>The ground plane should be on the order of a wavelength in diameter (i.e. a
    pizza pan 14&quot; in diameter should work nicely). I picked up some inexpensive
    steel pans at the super market ($4 each). They're plated with some sort of shiny
    metal and not real thick. Copper sheet or some strips of copper tape might be
    necessary to get the ground plane resistance down, but without a calibrated
    antenna range, it will be hard to tell. </p>
<p>Supporting the helix is a bit tricky, depending on how rugged I want it to
    be. Finding a suitable piece of pipe and just gluing it to the ground plane
    might be one approach. This has the advantage of being quite rugged. Another
    approach is to use struts, which makes it a bit more fragile, but a lot lighter
    weight. Making a tube from thin plastic sheet rolled up (like a plastic placemat,
    for instance) is another possibility.</p>
<p>For now, I've chosen to cut some lengths of 3&quot; PVC Sch 40 pipe. (3.5 inches
    OD, 3.068 ID) 45 cm long ( a bit less than 18&quot;) and epoxy them to the steel
    pizza pans. A TNC connector is used to feed through and connect to the helix
    (it's a bit more rugged than an SMA, and they also match what I have for old
    cell phone antennas). The pair of ground planes are bolted with 10-32 machine
    screws (4 places) to a piece of 1&quot;x2&quot;x1/8&quot; aluminum channel that
    is 2 feet long. It looks like some sort of science fiction death ray, and will
    probably get the &quot;homeland security&quot; folks after me. Upon an improvised
    stress test (I dropped it), the epoxy failed between the PVC and the steel (probably
    not enough epoxy in the right place, and not cured long enough). I'll re-epoxy
    it, and put some small screws into the PVC. [Note from 10 Nov, reglued, added
    some #4 wood screws, and it's pretty rugged, although with the heavy PVC pipe
    on it, the ground planes are now the &quot;weakest link&quot;.]</p>
<p>The actual helix is wound from 1&quot; copper foil tape. I marked the tubing
    at the appropriate spacing (8 cm) on two roughly opposite sides. I then wound
    the tape (with its paper backing) to hit the marks, adjusting the pitch and
    windings so that the tape lays flat. The paper doesn't stretch, so when you're
    done, it is a truly even spaced helix. A small piece of tape at each end holds
    it in place. Then, I marked along the edge of the foil tape with a marker to
    give me a guide for when I stuck the tape down for real. Peel the backing, stick
    the tape, and it's done.</p>
<p>To tune it and adjust the feed impedance, a standard technique is to bend the
    first turn a bit so that it is closer to the ground plane, and forms a transformer
    to change the nominal 140 ohm input to 75 or 50 ohms, as needed. With the copper
    foil tape, I just set the helix so it ended right before the connector, and
    then trimmed it back a bit. Some <a href="helixmatch.htm">more</a> on matching
    calculations.</p>
<h4>The finished product</h4>
<p>It's a bit heavy (3 feet of 3&quot; Sch 40 PVC pipe weighs a lot!). With no
    adjustment, I checked out the match using a fancy network analyzer. The return
    loss on both was better than -10 dB, and more like -14 to -15 dB. Part of the
    reason the match is so poor is that it was tested sitting on a bench next to
    me, a shelf, and the rack with the network analyzer, as you can tell from the
    overall waviness in the return loss curve (particularly look at the Left Hand
    helix, which was closer to me). Even aggravating this is that the test was done
    in a shielded room, so the antenna was pointing at the metal ceiling about 1
    meter away (although, given that the antenna is CP, the first reflection shouldn't
    make any difference).</p>
