<h2>Quad sloping dipole</h2>
<p>This is an idea for a rapidly erected field antenna with a single mast supporting 
  3 or 4 sloping dipoles. The dipoles act as the guys. Conceivably, one can switch 
  them in and out to get some directivity, particularly if you were to switch 
  some sort of impedance in at the feed points to make them shorter or longer 
  electrically. The other idea is to put a switchable feed at the top, which, 
  if you short the feed point in the middle of the dipole, makes it into an inverted 
  V. This might make a practical multiband antenna, although, I don't know that 
  there is any real radiation efficiency advantage in a inverted V over an electrically 
  short sloped dipole. (Later comment (Dec '02): I suspect that the inverted V 
  might work better, because the high current part of the antenna (near the feed) 
  is higher above the ground)</p>
<h3>Starting point for design.</h3>
<p>I'm going to assume a 10 meter high mast, and elements that are about 10 meters 
  long, sloped out at 30 degrees (i.e. 5 meters away from the tower at the bottom.</p>
<p>Here's a NEC model file</p>
