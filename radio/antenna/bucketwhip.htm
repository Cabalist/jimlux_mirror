            <p>I needed a quick and dirty vertical to test the <a href="../atv.htm">ATV
                setup</a> in the bucket bot. I've spent some time coming up with clever
                <a href="bucket1.htm">omnidirectional circularly polarized antennas</a>,
                but I wanted something easier; <i>i.e.</i> construction time&lt;5 minutes.
                What I did was stick a BNC connector through the bottom of the bucket.
                A 17 cm long piece of bare AWG#12 copper wire was soldered to the center
                contact (after filing the end of the wire down so that it would fit in
                the solder cup. The ground plane was 4 pieces of 1&quot; copper foil tape
                stuck to the base of the bucket in a cross.</p>

<p>It works, after a fashion. The real problem is that the whip isn't very flexible,
    and it broke off the connector when driving around. The sharp end of the whip
    is also a bit of a safety hazard, which I fixed by sticking one of those foam
    antenna balls on it. The mass of the ball aggravated the structural problems
    though.</p>
<p>A bit of modeling shows that the match isn't all that hot (about 29 ohms, with
    a healthy reactive component), but, the output transistor from the transmitter
    doesn't get too hot, and the mismatch will only reduce the radiated power by
    about 0.5 to 1 dB, so we'll leave it this way for a while.</p>
