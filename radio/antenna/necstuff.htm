<p> <em>&gt; what data card do I have to add to the nec2 input file </em><br>
  <em>&gt;to get the complete Z-matrix (or something else which gets the </em><br>
  <em>&gt;strength of mutual coupling between two antennas or the ports </em><br>
  <em>&gt;of a two-port antenna)? </em><br>
<p>You probably do not need the Z matrix. It relates the amplitudes of the spline 
  basis functions to the fields at the segment centers with the structure not 
  there (open-circuit impedance matrix, so every segment is an open port). The 
  matrix Y=Inverse[Z] relates the fields at points on 
  the structure with all of the structure present to the basis function 
  amplitudes. However, NEC uses L/U decomposition to get the solution, so 
  you would have to compute the inverse and then apply a transformation as 
  done in subroutine TBF to convert basis function amplitudes to currents 
  at segment centers. 
<p>This is done for you in the currents printed in the output. Just excite 
  the antenna ports one at a time, and the currents on the segments 
  representing the other ports will give the mutual admittances. Remember 
  that regular segments are short-circuited ports unless you excite them 
  with a voltage source. However, a segment with a network or transmission
  line connection (NT or TL command) is open circuited unless you
  explicitly short it. One way to short circuit a network-segment port
  is to put a very small voltage source on it (like 1.e-10, but anything
  less than 1.e-20 will be turned into one volt by NEC). Then the current
  in this small voltage source (but not the segment current) will be the
  short-circuit current in the port. We forgot about shorting network
  ports in NEC-2, so the maximum coupling calculation (CP command) is not
  correct when networks or transmission lines are involved.

<p>
<p>You might try computing the S-parameter coupling, because it is the easiest 
  to measure at RF and microwaves and therefore the most widely used at those 
  frequencies. <br>
<p>The S-parameters are easily calculated after running NEC by using the NEC currents 
  on the source segments. A resistor must be included at each port in the NEC 
  model to provide the impedance of a match terminated transmission line connected 
  to the port. The transmission line feature of NEC is not required. The following 
  applies to any multiport, including the two-port case. 
<p><br>
<p>The NEC model is run with one antenna or port excited by a voltage source Vg 
  in series with an impedance Rg. The other antennas or ports are not excited, 
  but they are also terminated in Rg. Rg is most commonly 50 ohms but could be 
  any finite impedance (I have always used equal, real Rg on all ports, although 
  in principle it should be possible to do something similar with unequal Rg on 
  each port or a complex generator impedance). 
<p><br>
<p>With the excited antenna or port designated as port #i, the voltages directly 
  across the ports or antenna inputs are: <br>
<p>Vi = Vg - Ii * Rg (for driven port i) <br>
<p>Vn = -In * Rg (for all undriven ports, i.e. n not equal to i) <br>
<p>Vi (i.e. the voltage across the driven port) is not equal to the NEC <br>
  excitation voltage Vg due to the voltage drop across Rg. The currents on the 
  <br>
  undriven ports are the result of coupling. The next step is that all <br>
  voltages and currents, including those for port i, are now normalized using 
  <br>
  the square root of Rg: <br>
<p>For all n including n = i: <br>
<p>Vn' = Vn / sqrt(Rg) <br>
<p>In' = In * sqrt(Rg) <br>
<p>The forward and scattered waves (a and b respectively) at each port (a 50 <br>
  ohm transmission line if Rg = 50) are then given by: <br>
<p>an = (Vn' + In') / 2 <br>
<p>bn = (Vn' - In') / 2 <br>
<p>for all n where n is the port number. <br>
<p>and the resulting mutual S-parameter coupling Sn,i between port i and port 
  n is: <br>
<p>Sn,i = bn / ai <br>
<p>Additional information on obtaining S-parameters from V and I is given in <br>
  some books including Microwave Engineering by R.E.Collin, McGraw-Hill, 1966, 
  <br>
  p.171. A paper we presented at the 1994 ACES Conference in Monterey (pg. <br>
  504) also includes some illustrations and a comparison of measured <br>
  S-parameters with those calculated using NEC. 
<p><br>
<p>If NEC were perfectly accurate then the computed Sn,i would be exactly the 
  <br>
  same as the S12 parameter measured by a perfectly accurate network analyzer. 
  <br>
  Rg needs to be the same as the impedance of the network analyzer and the <br>
  coax used. If a balun is used in the measurement setup then if it is working 
  <br>
  ideally it would not affect the S-parameters, but Rg does need to be <br>
  adjusted to include any impedance transformation provided by the balun. <br>
  Alternatively, when the complete S-matrix is computed between all antenna <br>
  ports, then the S-matrix can be transformed to incorporate the s-matrix of <br>
  attached baluns and matching units, which I found to be challenging for a <br>
  multiport, involving inverses and considerable matrix manipulations. It's <br>
  easier to use Touchstone or some other RF circuit simulator that can provide 
  <br>
  a multiport device defined by it's S-matrix, and then add the other feed <br>
  components to the S-matrix of the antenna ports. <br>

  There is quite a body of published material on antennas mounted on <br>
