<p>Feeding the Double X</p>
<p>There are three basic feeding patterns for the Double X.</p>
<p>For an end fire pattern, the elements are fed across the ridge line.</p>

<p>For a broadside type pattern, the elements are grouped differently, and fed
    this way</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally, you can also feed them so you get a 45 degree angle</p>

<p>Obviously, one can mirror or reverse the above schemes to get the rest of the
    8 cardinal directions.</p>
<p>How much phase shift?</p>
<p>The phase center of the sloped inverted V is somewhat indeterminate, so doing
    a phasing calculation based on isotropic point source radiators isn't particularly
    useful. Instead, a series of simulations were run using NEC2 with current sources
    on each element and adjusting the phasing.</p>
