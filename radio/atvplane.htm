<h2>Sailplane with ATV</h2>
<p>Here's some details on how the ATV installation went in the sailplane. Sorry, 
  no pictures of the installed setup, because it was cannibalized before I got 
  the digital camera.</p>
<p>The antenna was a &quot;bent dipole&quot; made from copper foil tape on the 
  vertical stabilizer and the fuselage. Having a network analyzer at work made 
  figuring out the dimensions pretty easy. I just stuck the tape onto a piece 
  of paper, hung it up, and started adjusting the angle and length until I had 
  a decent match. Then, I copied the design onto the airplane, and repeated for 
  a final trim (negligible trimming was actually required). The feed was just 
  a coax line running up the fuselage (balun? we don't need no stinkin' balun, 
  who cares if the feedline screws up the pattern) terminated in a male SMA that 
  connected to the TXA5-70's output (which had a female SMA).</p>
<p>The sailplane was an ARF (almost ready to fly) kit with a 2m wingspan. Adding 
  the camera and transmitter to the nose made it a bit heavy, so the sink rate 
  was pretty high and you had to fly it pretty fast (I had a friend fly it, since 
  I am a lame R/C pilot). I did find out a few interesting things. The receiver 
  was fed by a drooped groundplane type 1/4 wave vertical antenna on a mike stand. 
  Multipath was EVIL. The picture would go from sparkling clear and full color 
  (very impressive) to total snow and back in seconds. A most impressive demonstration 
  of Rayleigh fading. The periodic station ID required was handled by the simple 
  expedient of pointing the plane's camera at a piece of paper with W6RMK (my 
  call) printed on it in big letters.</p>

      <p>Here's the nose of the plane. The R/C receiver and its batteries installs 
        under the push rods, instead of the nose where it normally would go on 
        this kit). The R/C receiver antenna is fed through a lowpass feed through 
        in the canopy. Copper foil tape provides the ground plane for the feedthrough, 
        and also was used to create a shielded box for the receiver.</p>
      <p>Eventually, the radio batteries were moved up front, under the nose.</p>

      (the PC board for the camera, and the PC board for the ATV transmitter) 
      goes in the front compartment. You can see the copper foil added to make 
      a sort of &quot;shielded box&quot;. Nose of the plane is covered in PVC 
      tape for two reasons: 1) To hold everything on; and 2) to hold the ballast 
      weights in place.</td>

<h3>Weight and Balance problems</h3>
<p>The real problem with this setup is that it added enough mass to the plane 
  to really increase the sink rate. In order to keep it flying, you had to be 
  going pretty fast, or have a huge updraft wind to hold it up. Bob sith, my R/C 
  flying friend, who was actualy trying to fly the plane, suggested a &quot;power 
  pod&quot;, and, if I ever fool with this again, that's probably what I'll do.
