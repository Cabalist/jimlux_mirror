<h2>APRS - Automatic Position Reporting System</h2>
<p>This is a pretty nifty system using amateur packet radio. A GPS receiver (a 
  <a href="http://www.garmin.com/">Garmin</a> GPS III, in my case) sends a continuous 
  stream of messages out the RS232 port with the position, heading, and speed 
  (as well as a lot of other stuff). A device called a TNC (Terminal Node Controller) 
  which is basically a modem with a microcontroller looks at the messages and 
  parses the ones of interest. Once a minute (or whatever I program it to do), 
  it transmits a message with the information parsed from the GPS messages. The 
  transmission is 1200 baud FSK over the 2 meter amateur band (at 144.39 MHz) 
  using a run of the mill Kenwood TH22 handheld radio. One or more receiving stations 
  will hear the message (hopefully). The message gets retransmitted over the air 
  to anyone who wants to receive it, and, it gets transmitted to a central internet 
  location where a database is kept of the most recent messages. There is also 
  a way to do this on HF frequencies, for longer range applications. On HF, the 
  standard frequency is 10.151 MHz (in the &quot;30 Meter&quot; band).</p>

  - the new APRS web server in Southern California</p>
<p>the web server on port 8000 at www.aprs.net looks in its database for the most 
  recent message from my station (w6rmk-5) and generates a dynamic HTML page with 
  links to mapblast.com for the maps. The original port is up and down, and is 
  in Florida, so it doesn't always work. There is now an APRS internet server 
  up in Southern California at second.aprs.net.</p>
<p>Another nifty thing is if someone puts up a carefully surveyed fixed GPS receiver, 
  differential corrections can be transmitted over the APRS frequencies, so that 
  other APRS users can correct their GPS measurements, achieving accuracies of 
  around a meter. Those corrections would also be &quot;served&quot; over the 
  internet.</p>
<p>Larry at Purple Computing makes Garmin compatible connectors as &quot;sharehardware&quot;. 
  His web site is <a href="http://www.pfranc.com/">http://www.pfranc.com/</a>. 
  It's a much better deal than the $50 cable from Garmin.</p>
