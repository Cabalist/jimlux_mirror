<h2>GPS Frequency Stabilization of HF Data Links</h2>
<p>There is a need for automated HF digital data links that don't require active
    operator intervention. An example would be a HF APRS station broadcasting GPS
    position data. Unfortunately, most amateur HF data links are quite narrow band
    (few hundred Hz channel) and require fairly precise tuning (10 Hz) for decent
    error performance.Typical synthesized consumer HF transceivers don't have very
    good frequency accuracy: a typical spec of 100ppm would be good, and at 10 MHz,
    this is 1 kHz . I think the use of narrowband schemes and tight frequency tolerance
    is mostly for historical reasons, since they evolved from RTTY (45 baud 170
    Hz shift) and HF Packet modems based on Bell 202 standard. Certainly, there
    isn't any good performance or legal reason to use such a narrow bandwidth. For
    a manually established link, the operator just tunes up and down, watching the
    tuning indicator on the modem. This is not acceptable for an automated link.</p>
<p>Several solutions are possible: 1) Use a better transceiver with better frequency
    stability (some transceivers have TCXO's as an option); 2) Use a modulation
    scheme that is wider-band and tolerant of mistuning (or that has AFC); and 3)
    determine the tuning error and correct it on the fly. Strategy 1 is expensive,
    or possibly not available. Strategy 2 has the problem of incompatibility with
    the existing installed base, and further, the high signal density in some areas
    and limited receiver instantaneous dynamic range means that you need narrow
    IF filters for adjacent channel rejection. </p>
<p>This page discusses a scheme for the third strategy, measuring the transmitter
    (and hence the receiver) frequency error, and then retuning to account for the
    error. The scheme is simple, and uses parts of the system that already are there
    for a typical APRS GPS tracker. The idea is to use the 1pps tick from the gps
    receiver as a timing gate for a frequency counter to measure the actual transmitted
    frequency of the transmitter. Typical commodity GPS receivers (that have a 1pps
    output) are accurate to 500 nSec, or 0.5 ppm, on the 1pps output, when moving.
    This is sufficient to get 10 Hz measurement (and hence) tuning accuracy on HF
    links in the 30meter band (10 MHz).</p>

<p>A simple frequency counter, which could be as simple as a 8 or 16 bit counter,
    measures a sample of the transmitted carrier. (you could also measure some significant
    internal signal from the transceiver, if available). The measured frequency
    is then used to change the transmitter/receiver frequency, either by changing
    the frequencies in the AFSK modem, or by sending actual commands to the transceiver.
    The counter can be very simple, because we are really only interested in the
    difference in frequency from that expected, since we have sent a tuning command
    to the transceiver (either explicitly, or as a channel select). For instance,
    a 16 bit counter would give a range of +/- 32 kHz to work with.</p>
