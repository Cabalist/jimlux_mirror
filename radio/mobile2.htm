<h3>General View</h3>
<p><a name="general"></a>General side view of the installation, showing the plate
    and aluminum tubes. I mounted the screwdriver antenna at the back of the plate,
    figuring I didn't need ground plane for it, and that the car body would be the
    counterpoise anyway. Later, I can stick an NMO mount in the middle of the plate
    for VHF and UHF. Who knows what sort of interaction there will be between the
    UHF whip and that big old pipe behind it?</p>

<h3>Overhead view of matching transformer and antenna base</h3>
<p><a name="ohview"></a>Sort of an overhead view of the matching transformer and
    the base of the screwdriver antenna. The white wire is a AWG 10 stranded ground
    wire that goes to the bolt holding the rack rails in place.</p>

<h3>Mounting clamp detail</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="clamp"></a>Detail of the U-bolt clamps. They're 5/16&quot; bolts with
    2&quot; between the legs, which nicely straddles the bar of the Thule rack.
    I put vinyl tubing over the bolt for &quot;anti squeak&quot; and to protect
    the finish on the Thule rack. A bit of Loctite on the nuts will keep them from
    vibrating off.</p>
