<h2>Icom PCR1000 computer controlled receiver</h2>
<p>I now have a PCR1000 computer controlled receiver in the shack. It's a pretty
    nifty device, tuning 100 kHz to 1.3 GHz, and one that represents a trend I'd
    like to see more of. It is controlled entirely through an RS-232 serial interface
    (with the protocol not officially published, unfortunately), has an RF input,
    an audio output, and that's about it. The nifty thing is that all the building
    blocks within the receiver are independently configurable. If you, for some
    reason, wanted to use the 15 kHz IF filter and the USB demodulator, it will
    let you do this.</p>
<p>I kind of wish that someone would make a device like this with an ethernet
    interface, and send the audio via some useful protocol. I'd also like the ability
    to lock the receiver to an external phase/frequency reference (like my <a href="Z3801.htm">Z3801</a>),
    but hey, those aren't really being demanded by consumers, yet. Pretty soon though,
    the omnipresent browser will serve as the front panel.</p>
<p>I understand that it is fairly well calibrated, so you can use it in a (scalar)
    reflectometer, for instance. </p>
<p>I've thought about using it to measure propagation using chirp beacons that
    are transmitted. ZL1BPU has a good description of G3PLX's <a href="http://www.qsl.net/zl1bpu/chirp/chirps.html" target="_blank">chirp
        sounder project</a> on his web site. They used a Motorola 56K EVM to do the
    processing, but I've been thinking that a sound card in a PC, and then some
    post processing, might work just as well.</p>
<p>I've scrounged around the web and found some useful links, including some claims
    for the protocol.</p>

        http://geophysics.ou.edu/ahern/home/pcr1000/ </a> - links and descriptions of what it points to...

    <li><a href="http://polywog.navpoint.com/www/icomlib.phtml">
        http://polywog.navpoint.com/www/icomlib.phtml</a> also has a lot of info, including
        some source code.. and a link to the above file.

        good description of protocol... doesn't appear to deal with the "periodic
        handshake", but maybe if you keep sending commands, it doesn't need one?
