<h2>HF mobile phased arrays</h2>
<p>While driving the family mini-van up I-5 over the Fourth of July holiday, with
    lots of time to think, I was contemplating the idea of a phased array for mobile
    operation. Sure, one could use a single whip, but it has a strange pattern (typically
    oriented towards the direction away from the whip, across the roof of the car)
    and some really noticeable nulls (like straight up). I started thinking that
    if you were to put 4 whips, at the corners of the roof, you could phase them
    to synthesize some useful patterns. You could use a compass (or GPS) to automatically
    keep the &quot;beam&quot; steered in the correct direction (or, for the truly
    amazing, use an adaptive antenna scheme).</p>
<p>On VHF or UHF, this would be a very powerful technique. On HF though, you get
    bitten by the fact that the cross ways axis isn't all that long (about 4 feet
    on a Dodge/Plymouth/Chrysler minivan, about a tenth of a wavelength on 10m,
    and even worse as you go lower) so you're going to have some problems with mutual
    coupling and high element currents. It's going to be a pain to feed and steer.</p>
<p>Then, I started thinking about what you really need in that HF antenna. You're
    not going to get the searchlight beam you'd get from a 50 foot yagi, because
    the aperture isn't there. However, what you can get, and what I think is actually
    useful, is the ability to null an interfering signal on receive. For this, you
    could just use two antennas, one of them an omni(ish) receive only. It occurred
    to me that multiple transmitting antennas might be nice (so you don't wind up
    transmitting into the null of your bumper or roof mounted element's pattern),
    but two antennas which you switch between might be sufficient.</p>
<p>This has been anticipated by a variety of folks who are researching the problem
    of getting NVIS propagation from military vehicles. Their solution is to actually
    drive the body of the vehicle at several points (like the windshield sides (the
    A pillars). The body would be RF hot, but it is anyway, when you have a whip
    antenna (unless you are trying to beat the CC&amp;R's by mounting a 40 foot
    crank up tower in the bed of a pickup truck).</p>
<h3>Onward to some modeling and analysis.</h3>
