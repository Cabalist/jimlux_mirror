The primary challenge in a passive beamformer is creating the correct element
currents to create the desired pattern. The basic technique I use is to
do it in the following&nbsp; steps:
<UL>
    <LI>
        Determine the element feedpoint impedances
    </LI>

    <LI>
        Transform that impedance to a purely resistive high impedance with a low
        pass L network
    </LI>

    <LI>
        Use a pi network to get the necessary phase shift
    </LI>

    <LI>
        Combine the L and pi networks into a single T network
    </LI>

    <LI>
        Transform the T network into an equivalent pi network
    </LI>
</UL>
The element feedpoint impedances are calculated using the array of element
mutual impedances. The element currents are set to the desired magnitude
and phase to create the desired pattern. The voltages at each element are
calculated with the mutual impedances. The feed point impedance at each
element is then simply the Voltage over the Current.

<P>A low pass L network is then used to transform the complex feed point
    impedance to a high resistive impedance. And, the effect of the transmission
    line connecting the beamformer to the antenna must be taken into account,
    since it is unlikely that the feedpoint impedance will happen to just match
    the feedline characteristic impedance. These transformations are addressed
    in the page on transmission line equations. The choice of the resistive
    impedance is somewhat arbitrary, however, it should be higher than the
    magnitude of the feed point impedance, to insure that the capacitor is
    on the input side of the network. This allows the series reactance of the
    feed point (the jX component) to be absorbed by making the series L larger
    or smaller. The input C value is not critical, as it is later combined
    with the C of the phase shift network.

<P>A pi network is then calculated to create the proper phase shift&nbsp;
    from the common feed point to the element feedpoing. The L network will
    have some phase shift, so the phase shift necessary in the pi network needs
    to take that additional shift into account.&nbsp; Finally, the input impedance
    to the pi network needs to be adjusted so that element receives the correct
    amount of power which is discussed in the <A HREF="pwrdiv.htm">page on
        power division</A>. More information is available on <A HREF="wyedelta.htm#synth">pi
        and L network synthesis.</A>

    <BR>We now have a low pass pi network feeding a low pass L network. The
    output capacitor on the pi network and the input capacitor on the L network
    can be combined.&nbsp; All of the feed sides of the pi networks will be
    connected in parallel. So, we redraw the circuit to show it as a capacitor
    (at the feed end) feeding a lowpass T network which then feeds the antenna.

<P>The next step is to transform the T network into an equivalent pi network,
    using a standard transformation which is also <A HREF="wyedelta.htm#pit">documented</A>.

<P><IMG SRC="images/ttopi.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=103 WIDTH=285>
    <BR>And, the final step is to pull the first shunt C of the pi out and
    combine it with the original pi network shunt C, leaving just an L network

<P><IMG SRC="images/adjl.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=107 WIDTH=278>

<P>Of course, in an actual system, some of the shunt X of the pi networks
    will turn out to be positive (i.e. inductive). However, since they wind
    up being combined in parallel with other shunt X's, some of which will
    be negative, the net effect is to require only one reactive shunt component
    for the entire beamformer input.

<P>In practice, an iterative approach may be necessary to find the virtual
    R in the step where the L network is synthesized to transform the antenna/feedline
    to a resistive impedance, and some iteration will be necessary to find
    a set of phase shifts which produce element impedances of the correct signs
    for all networks. Recall that it is only the relative phases between element
    currents that are important, so adding a constant phase shift to all elements
    has no effect on the pattern.

<P>Another approach to calculating the network component values is to create
    a matrix equation of the beamformer and the elements, then solve for the
    values of the variable elements, subject to suitable constraints. Some
    initial work has been done in this area, however, experimentally, I have
    found that the Excel 97 solver (which is essentially a gradient search
    solver) often does not converge to a solution.

<P>Another thing to consider is that the adjustable networks have discrete
    values and are not continuously adjustable. Probably the best approach
    in the long run is to iteratively solve the matrix equation attempting
    to find a set of discrete element values that results in the element currents
    most closely matching the desired distribution. In fact, given the uncertainty
    in the initial mutual element impedance values (either by calculation or
    measurement) this approach, done in real time, will probably be the most
    successful.

<P>The network synthesis and development described above, though, is useful,
    in that it shows that it is possible to create a passive beamforming network
    using a whole bunch of adjustable L networks, as available from LDG and
    others.
