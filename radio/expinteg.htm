<h2>Sine and Cosine Integrals</h2>
<p>The cosine and sine integrals are defined by:</p>
<p>Ci(x) = EulersConstant + ln(x) + integral[0, infinity]( (cos(t)-1)/t dt)</p>
<p>Si(x) = integral[0,infinity]( sin(t)/t dt)</p>
<p>There are some identities to handle various signs of the arguments, and so
    forth (obviously, it is a challenge to take Ci(-1)).</p>
<p><a href="euler.htm">Euler's constant</a> is approximately 0.57721556... It
    pops up (oddly enough) in the Exponential integrals, but also in reference to
    prime numbers and other number theory areas. My <a href="euler.htm">Euler's
        Constant page</a> has a bunch more detail, and some links to web sites that
    give a lot more information on this sort of thing, if you are curious (I was).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ulib.org/webRoot/Books/Numerical_Recipes/">Numerical Recipes in
    Fortran book </a>has a Fortran subroutine for calculating sine and cosine integrals
    using a series expansions. A pdf version of the book section is at:</p>

    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A VisualBasic module to calculate sine and cosine integrals that I wrote is
    also available. (<a href="./download/ExponentialIntegral.bas">ExponentialIntegral.bas</a>)
    Both the Fortran and the VB routines calculate both Si and Ci at the same time.</p>
