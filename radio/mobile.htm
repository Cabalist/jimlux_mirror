<h2>Mobile Rig - W6RMK</h2>
<p>Finally, I'm getting my mobile rig put together. One of the challenges was
    figuring out a way to mount antennas without drilling holes in my car (not that
    I haven't drilled holes before, but it's a challenge to do without). Then, there's
    the issue of powering the rig, making it re-movable, etc. I'd also like to figure
    out how to set it up so I can move it to the Landcruiser with minimum hassle.
    It looks like lots of connectors are going to be involved.</p>
<h3>HF Antenna</h3>
<p>I looked around at HF antenna options, of which there seems to be three general
    classes: fixed whips, with tuning coils added/removed by banana jack jumpers,
    etc.; A straight whip with an automatic antenna tuner (the SGC QMS system being
    a good, but not the only, example); and various incarnations of &quot;screwdriver&quot;
    antennas (which have a sliding loading/tuning coil in the middle driven by a
    modified electric screwdriver). One constraint was that I wanted to be able
    to move the antenna between the two cars (VW Passat Wagon and Landcruiser),
    in some fashion. </p>
<p>I haven't operated mobile all that much (except VHF into repeaters, for instance),
    but somehow, the idea of adjustability without having to stop and get out was
    appealing. Relays and jumpers would work, but requires fabrication. The ATU
    with a whip is appealing, but, when I was looking into this stuff a year or
    so back, it was expensive ($500+ for the SGC SmartTuner); of course, now, SGC
    has a cheaper box out to do the job. I finally settled on the screwdriver approach,
    and after looking at the plethora of plans and versions on the web, I took the
    easy way out and stopped at HRO on the way home one day, and just bought what
    they had in stock: the NottLtd BBC3. Now to mount it.</p>
<p>The usual scheme with these antennas is something that fits into a trailer
    hitch receiver, a solution that would work admirably for the Landcruiser, which
    has a hitch. Some fabrication might be nice to put the antenna in a good place:
    off to the side and high enough that the coil and whip are above the roofline.
    Or, when we get a brushguard for the front, we can mount the antenna up there,
    Aussie style. But, the Passat doesn't have a hitch, and when I crawled underneath,
    there weren't any likely places for a hitch or for bracketry. The other approach
    was to make a bracket in the front; no luck there either, no obvious place to
    bolt it. </p>

            <p>Finally, I decided to figure out how to mount it to the luggage rack.
                I had bought a bike rack a while back, so I built a little platform using
                1&quot; aluminum square tubing and a 12x24&quot; piece of 1/16&quot; diamond
                plate. Unfortunately, the diamond plate flexes a bit too much, so I added
                a piece of OSB (chipboard) under the bottom to stiffen it, and now it's
                pretty rigid. The tubing is held to the rack cross members with u-bolts
                (covered in vinyl tubing). The hardware is all vanilla cad or zinc plated,
                and will probably rust in the next 6 months, especially bolted to all
                that aluminum, but for now, it works. I picked up a body ground by connecting
                to one of the rack attachment bolts, under a nice plastic trim cover at
                the rear.</p>
            <p>In the picture at right (clickable for a bigger version), you can see
                the white PVC cover over the tuning coil, and you can just see the antenna
                ball at the top of the stainless steel whip. This thing is a lot bigger
                looking than I expected.. no problems finding it in the parking lot!</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>
<p> This is distinctly not carwash friendly! Perhaps, a hinge or some sort of
    quick release scheme is called for.</p>
<p>Hmm.. seems to have a bad effect on gas mileage. Maybe? <a href="mobilempg.htm">More
    analysis here</a>..</p>
<h3><br>
    DC Power</h3>
<p>DC power is always an issue, especially if you're going to run 100W output
    power. I also have an aversion to directly connecting to the vehicle battery,
    based on long experience with destroying batteries, unforeseen interactions,
    etc. And, with new cars having so much electronics, I am concerned about EMI/EMC
    issues. In the past, my little portable APRS rig used a small 7Ah &quot;gel-cell&quot;
    charged off the accessory circuit through a diode, but I'm not sure it worked
    all that well. I did run the battery dead (killing it totally) when the PTT
    stuck on and the &quot;brick&quot; 2m amp sucked it flat. At least it was isolated
    from the vehicle supply, so I could still start the car.</p>
<p>This time, I figured I'd put a BIG deep cycle battery in the back and run the
    radios off that. I haven't figured out how to charge it yet, but, some sort
    of relay/charger scheme will probably work. Does anyone make a 12V(nominal)
    input battery charger? I whipped on down to Sears and got a 105 Ah marine battery
    (non-optimal) and a battery box. The batteries were on sale for $59.99 (+$7
    core). I will probably move that one to &quot;home backup&quot; duty, and get
    a sealed AGM wheelchair battery (Sears had one, at 45 Ah for $75, but no specs
    available on discharge rates) or similar, because I can just see the crud coming
    out of the marine battery corroding away the carpet, etc. For now, though, the
    battery is back there, strapped to the luggage tie down.</p>
<p>The power is brought to the front of the car via cabling made with 2 (for each
    side) AWG10 stranded conductors. Eventually, I'll build a little power distribution
    panel with a quick disconnect. For now, wire nuts are the answer. I also need
    to figure out how to route the cables.</p>
<h3>Radio mounting</h3>
<p>Still haven't done much with this yet.. It's at the radio on the seat stage.
    I am leaning towards building a nifty rotating table like WA8LMF built for his
    (older) Passat. Fairly simple, removable, etc.</p>
<p>I'd like the &quot;radio package&quot; to be easily pulled out for portable
    operation, etc.</p>
