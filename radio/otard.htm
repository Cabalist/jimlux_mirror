<h2>OTARD Stuff</h2>
<p>OTARD = Over The Air Reception Devices (i.e. Antennas and dishes).</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Several years back (1996), Congress passed a law designed to (among other things) 
  faciliate competition among the various means of distributing video programming. 
  Over the past few years, the FCC has generated rules, opinions, and orders to 
  implement the law. One of the things they did was formulate a set of rules that 
  essentially preempt laws and private restrictions that prohibit certain types 
  of antennas, and to provide guaranteed access to competitive providers.</p>
<p> Naturally, there is a lot of screaming and yelling from all sides on this. 
  The folks who want to distribute stuff by satellite or wireless (i.e. DirecTV, 
  etc.) don't want restrictions on people installing antennas. Homeowner's associations 
  and the folks who own apartment buildings don't want people putting up antennas 
  because of aesthetic concerns. The companies that already have a wire into apartments, 
  condos and homes also would prefer that the HOAs ban antennas. Finally, companies 
  who would like to put in new wires don't want HOAs and building owners signing 
  exclusive contracts with someone else.</p>
<p>So far, the FCC has been pretty firm in opening access and striking down restrictions 
  of various kinds. They've made the regulatory hurdles pretty high to create 
  a restriction, and placed the burden of proving that the restriction is reasonable 
  on the people wanting the restriction.</p>
<p>At first, the big activity was in the area of small dishes for DirecTV, EchoStar 
  and companies like that. Many, many condos and homeowner associations have blanket 
  antenna prohibition rules, most stemming from the big &quot;C-band&quot; dish 
  days, and the days of large external broadcast antennas. Abetted, to a certain 
  extent, by the cable TV providers, these rules were used to prevent the installation 
  (or at least, make really tedious and inconvenient) of the competing small dishes. 
</p>
<p>Now, though, the activity is heating up in the area of providing wireless services. 
  The existing rules cover only &quot;receiving devices&quot;, and don't make 
  any provision for transmitting (some HOA's have rules against transmitting, 
  although the enforceability might be questionable. Cell phones transmit, for 
  instance, as do garage door remotes, cordless phones, and so forth.). They also 
  limit the preemption to devices designed to receive (small dish satellite, broadcast 
  TV, etc.) what are essentially broadcast services.</p>
<p>However, the wireless networking folks are starting to press for an extension 
  to the rules to include their products, which provide internet connectivity, 
  ordinary telephone service, as well as the more traditional TV and broadcast 
  services. They feel that wireless schemes are the solution to the &quot;last 
  mile problem&quot;, referring to the fact that the difficult part of getting 
  a new service started is making the connection the &quot;last mile&quot; from 
  centralized distribution point to the user. The telephone company and cable 
  TV companies have made a substantial investment in physical plant to connect 
  that last mile, and, understandably, they aren't too wild about seeing alternative 
  schemes.</p>
<p>From the Homeowner Association point of view, I suppose that the addition of 
  the wireless (transmit/receive) to the rules won't make much difference. The 
  existing receive only rules already force an HOA to allow antennas less than 
  a meter in size, so the aesthetics impact is negligble. Any practical wireless 
  scheme isn't going to have an interference problem, so the practical impact 
  of allowing transmitting is negligible. There is a potential aesthetic issue 
  with folks wanting to put up multiple antennas (one for Ku-band satellite, another 
  for a wireless internet, and yet others for other providers), but the FCC has 
  already ruled in a &quot;receive only&quot; case that multiple antenna installations 
  can't be prohibited.</p>
<p>If HDTV ever catches on, I suspect we'll see another push to clarify the rules, 
  although since they are reception devices, they are already covered. (see the 
  NAB filing in Philip Wojcikiewicz's case CSR-6030-0)</p>
<p>FCC Fact Sheet on Placement of Antennas <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/otard.html" target="_blank"> 
  http://www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/otard.html</a> There are a bunch of links to relevant 
  cases at the bottom of the revised (May 2001) fact sheet. Some of them are below.</p>
Competitive Networks Report and Order, FCC 00-366, released October 25, 2000 <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Wireless/Orders/2000/fcc00366.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Wireless/Orders/2000/fcc00366.pdf</a>

<p>DA-00-2759 (12 Dec 2000.. brand new) Irvin &amp; Barbara Guterman - Dismissed 
  Petition for Declaratory Ruling seeking determination concerning OTARD rule..<a href="http://ftp.fcc.Bureaus/Cable/Orders/2000/da002759.txt" target="_blank">http://ftp.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Orders/2000/da002759.txt</a> 
  - The Gutermans were seeking a determination about whether the CC&amp;Rs for 
  their tract were consistent with the OTARD rules. Since the Gutermans didn't 
  send a sworn affidavit with the petition (even after their attorney was notified 
  by the FCC, twice), the FCC dismissed the petition.</p>

  http://ftp.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Orders/1997/da971554.txt</a> Meade KS ordinance 
  (and legal maneuvering) ruled against. Lots of detail about what the FCC considers 
  unreasonable: prior permission, vague rules, $5 fees. A lot of this was revisited 
  in the Second Order and Reconsideration when the FCC clarified their interpretation 
  of all the rules.</p>

  Petition seeking declaratory ruling that the homeowner association rules of 
  the Woodmere Townhome association of Darien, Illinois are preempted by the Commission's 
  Over-the-Air Reception devices rule</p>

  http://cctr.umkc.edu/dept/dirt/dd99/DD991025.htm</a> Fascinating analysis of 
  a wild case where somebody put up 5 masts 30 feet high, with 3 dishes, a bunch 
  of antennas, etc. The HOA, not surprisingly, balked. Oddly, though, the HOA's 
  rules weren't written all that well, and the FCC zapped them all. The author 
  of the analysis is pro HOA, and blasts the FCC somewhat, but his analysis is 
  valid, even if I disagree with some of his opinions.</p>

  Jason Peterson ("Petitioner") filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling ("Petition") 
  seeking a determination that the Declaration of Party Wall Right, Covenants, 
  Conditions, Restrictions and Easements for Chesapeake Commons ("Chesapeake Restrictions") 
  applicable to externally installed over- the-air video programming reception 
  antennas are prohibited by 47 C.F.R.  1.4000, the Commission's Over-the-Air 
  Reception Devices Rule ("Rule"). The Petition is unopposed. For the reasons 
  discussed below, we find that the Chesapeake Restrictions contravene the Rule 
  and are prohibited.</p>

  Victor Frankfurt ("Petitioner") filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling ("Petition")

  to externally mounted over-the-air video programming reception antennas of New 
  Century Town Townhouse Association No. 2 ("New Century") are prohibited by 47 
  C.F.R.  1.4000, the Commission's Over-the-Air Reception Devices Rule ("Rule").

<p>Declaratory Ruling, Victor Frankfurt, DA 01-0153, released February 7, 2001:

  - More trials and tribulations for Victor Frankfurt and New Century.. New Century 
  redoes its rules to try and make them appear to be safety related, but the FCC 
  carefully examines the new rules and finds that most are aesthetic concerns 
  (concealing wires and cables), or unnecessarily burdensome</p>
