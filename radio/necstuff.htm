<p><em>&gt; what data card do I have to add to the nec2 input file </em><br>
    <em>&gt;to get the complete Z-matrix (or something else which gets the </em><br>

<p>You probably do not need the Z matrix. It relates the amplitudes of the spline
    basis functions to the fields at the segment centers with the structure not
    there (open-circuit impedance matrix, so every segment is an open port). The
    matrix Y=Inverse[Z] relates the fields at points on
    the structure with all of the structure present to the basis function
    amplitudes. However, NEC uses L/U decomposition to get the solution, so
    you would have to compute the inverse and then apply a transformation as
    done in subroutine TBF to convert basis function amplitudes to currents
    at segment centers.
<p>This is done for you in the currents printed in the output. Just excite
    the antenna ports one at a time, and the currents on the segments
    representing the other ports will give the mutual admittances. Remember
    that regular segments are short-circuited ports unless you excite them
    with a voltage source. However, a segment with a network or transmission
    line connection (NT or TL command) is open circuited unless you
    explicitly short it. One way to short circuit a network-segment port
    is to put a very small voltage source on it (like 1.e-10, but anything
    less than 1.e-20 will be turned into one volt by NEC). Then the current
    in this small voltage source (but not the segment current) will be the
    short-circuit current in the port. We forgot about shorting network
    ports in NEC-2, so the maximum coupling calculation (CP command) is not
    correct when networks or transmission lines are involved.

<p>
<p>You might try computing the S-parameter coupling, because it is the easiest
    to measure at RF and microwaves and therefore the most widely used at those
    frequencies. <br>
<p>The S-parameters are easily calculated after running NEC by using the NEC currents
    on the source segments. A resistor must be included at each port in the NEC
    model to provide the impedance of a match terminated transmission line connected
    to the port. The transmission line feature of NEC is not required. The following
    applies to any multiport, including the two-port case.
<p><br>
<p>The NEC model is run with one antenna or port excited by a voltage source Vg
    in series with an impedance Rg. The other antennas or ports are not excited,
    but they are also terminated in Rg. Rg is most commonly 50 ohms but could be
    any finite impedance (I have always used equal, real Rg on all ports, although
    in principle it should be possible to do something similar with unequal Rg on
    each port or a complex generator impedance).
<p><br>
<p>With the excited antenna or port designated as port #i, the voltages directly
    across the ports or antenna inputs are: <br>
<p>Vi = Vg - Ii * Rg (for driven port i) <br>
<p>Vn = -In * Rg (for all undriven ports, i.e. n not equal to i) <br>
<p>Vi (i.e. the voltage across the driven port) is not equal to the NEC <br>
    excitation voltage Vg due to the voltage drop across Rg. The currents on the
    <br>
    undriven ports are the result of coupling. The next step is that all <br>
    voltages and currents, including those for port i, are now normalized using
    <br>
    the square root of Rg: <br>
<p>For all n including n = i: <br>
<p>Vn' = Vn / sqrt(Rg) <br>
<p>In' = In * sqrt(Rg) <br>
<p>The forward and scattered waves (a and b respectively) at each port (a 50 <br>
    ohm transmission line if Rg = 50) are then given by: <br>
<p>an = (Vn' + In') / 2 <br>
<p>bn = (Vn' - In') / 2 <br>
<p>for all n where n is the port number. <br>
<p>and the resulting mutual S-parameter coupling Sn,i between port i and port
    n is: <br>
<p>Sn,i = bn / ai <br>
<p>Additional information on obtaining S-parameters from V and I is given in <br>
    some books including Microwave Engineering by R.E.Collin, McGraw-Hill, 1966,
    <br>
    p.171. A paper we presented at the 1994 ACES Conference in Monterey (pg. <br>
    504) also includes some illustrations and a comparison of measured <br>
    S-parameters with those calculated using NEC.
<p><br>
<p>If NEC were perfectly accurate then the computed Sn,i would be exactly the
    <br>
    same as the S12 parameter measured by a perfectly accurate network analyzer.
    <br>
    Rg needs to be the same as the impedance of the network analyzer and the <br>
    coax used. If a balun is used in the measurement setup then if it is working
    <br>
    ideally it would not affect the S-parameters, but Rg does need to be <br>
    adjusted to include any impedance transformation provided by the balun. <br>
    Alternatively, when the complete S-matrix is computed between all antenna <br>
    ports, then the S-matrix can be transformed to incorporate the s-matrix of <br>
    attached baluns and matching units, which I found to be challenging for a <br>
    multiport, involving inverses and considerable matrix manipulations. It's <br>
    easier to use Touchstone or some other RF circuit simulator that can provide
    <br>
    a multiport device defined by it's S-matrix, and then add the other feed <br>
    components to the S-matrix of the antenna ports. <br>
