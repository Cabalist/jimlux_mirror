<h2 align=center>The Global Positioning System</h2>
<h4 align=center>Technological Magic for Explorers of the New Millenium</h4>
<p style="text-align: center">Jim Lux &amp; Sally Lux</p>
<p>About five centuries ago, some brave explorers, using what was then secret military technology,
    ventured forth across the Atlantic Ocean to discover, among other things, South America. Some of
    the original users of this high technology were probably accused of witchcraft, burned at the stake,
    or at least required to answer to some distinctly unfriendly inquisitors. This technology, the map and
    magnetic compass, in a relatively short time, resulted in a revolution of exploration. As the &quot;secret&quot;
    of the map and compass spread, so did explorers of all kinds. For the first time, you could venture
    forth and have a reasonably good chance of arriving close to where you set out for.</p>
<p>Today, all of us explorers of South America are in a similar situation. A technology, originally
    developed for military applications, is becoming available to everyone, at a reasonable price.
    Fortunately, you probably don't risk being burned as witch for using it, either, even though it does
    seem like magic when you use it. For a few hundred dollars, you can go out and buy a handheld
    unit that will tell you where you are (including altitude), anywhere in the world, any time of day or
    night, in any weather, with an accuracy of about 30 feet. It's called the Global Positioning System
    (GPS), and it will revolutionize life for those of us who have a need to know where we are, where
    we were, and where we are going. This article explains a little bit about what GPS is and how it
    works, what kind of receivers are currently available, and the results of some of our field testing.</p>
<p>You may ask, &quot;Why would I want to know where I am within 30 feet?&quot; We provide the following
    &quot;true to life&quot; scenarios where having a GPS receiver proves useful, if not positively essential:</p>
<p>You have been hacking your way through almost impenetrable forest in the Andean foothills for
    two weeks. Suddenly, your partner falls into a hole and cries out in pain. When you peer over the
    edge, you see that what you have been walking on is the roof of a storeroom containing the Inca
    gold which was hidden away from the Spanish conquistadores, and that your partner is mortally
    wounded, having broken his leg on the legendary gold chain which once graced the House of the
    Sun. Heartless though it may seem, you decide that since it will take two weeks to get to medical
    attention, it is pointless to try and save your partner. Besides, his life insurance beneficiary is the
    South American Explorers Club, so many will benefit from his misfortune, if only you can find your
    way back to this location. You whip out your GPS receiver, wait a few seconds until it calculates
    and displays your location, and carefully note it. You cover over the hole so that your partner's
    moans and cries don't disturb the indigenous wildlife. When you return next year to retrieve the
    treasure, you can use the receiver to guide you to the exact spot. No more Lost Dutchman Mine or
    the Seven Cities of Cibola.</p>
<p>You are wandering, lost and confused, in the streets of Lima, searching for the succor of the South
    American Explorer's Club, however none of the street signs seem to be readable, even if you did
    know Spanish, and the map you have must have been drawn 50 years ago. Fortunately, you know
    the exact latitude and longitude of the clubhouse, so you get out the trusty GPS receiver, enter the
    coordinates of the clubhouse as your destination, and let it guide you onward. A few minutes later,
    you arrive, soon to be rested, informed, and ready for further exploration.</p>
<p>You get off the bus in the small, dusty town of San Cristobal, however, nothing looks like you
    expected. Asking the local residents, you discover that you may be at the &quot;wrong&quot; San Cristobal,
    having gotten on the wrong bus. The clouds of dust during the trip prevented you from seeing
    anything outside. You check your map, and find that there are 3 possible San Cristobals that you
    might be in. No problem: you take out the GPS receiver, get a fix, and instantly, you know that you
    are at San Cristobal de la Cruz, when you wanted to be at San Cristobal del Oro. Oh well, it's
    probably only another 20 hour bus ride back.</p>
<p>You are an anthropologist studying primitive indian settlements in the Amazon forest. You want to
    be able to return to each settlement after you find it, but all the rivers look the same from your boat.
    You use a handheld GPS unit to store the location of each settlement as you find it, and then use it
    to guide you back to it later. You can also use the locations stored in your GPS unit for identifying
    features on aerial photos taken with horizontal control from another GPS receiver, or standard
    satellite images. </p>
<h4>What is the Global Positioning System?</h4>
<p>A GPS receiver works by using radio signals transmitted from more than 20 satellites orbiting about
    11,000 miles above the earth.The information in the signals is used to calculate your position in a
    seconds or two, potentially to an accuracy of centimeters, although the inevitable noise and errors
    mean that positions are typically accurate to only(!) 30 feet. The system works anywhere in the
    world in any kind of weather as long as you can &quot;see&quot; enough of the sky so that you can receive the
    satellite signals (GPS signals go through clouds, so you don't need blue sky). It tells you not only
    your latitude and longitude, but also your elevation above (or below) sea level. Each satellite orbits
    the earth twice a day, so there are always new satellites &quot;rising&quot; and old satellites &quot;setting&quot;, with any
    one satellite &quot;in view&quot; about 3 or 4 hours per day. There are at least 4 satellites visible from
    anywhere on earth, any time of day, and in middle latitudes, you can often &quot;see&quot; seven or eight.</p>
<p>The system was originally designed by the United States Department of Defense for military
    purposes like guiding tanks and missiles. GPS receivers designed for the military originally cost
    $50,000 and up, putting them out of reach of mere civilian consumers. However, technology
    marches ever forward, so now, for less than a thousand dollars, you can buy a unit which works
    better than the original $50,000 units, and also fits in a (big) shirt pocket. Another nice feature is
    that the signals are available to anyone, anywhere in the world, without having to pay a user fee.</p>
<p>See the <a href="gpsside.htm">sidebar</a> for more information on how GPS works, how accurate it is, and more. </p>
<h4>How well does it work.</h4>
<p>The first thing you should know is that it works great! GPS is such an awesome advance over other
    ways of finding where you are that it seems like some sort of magic. Unfortunately, you rapidly get
    spoiled by being able to punch a button and find your location within a few feet. So, when you have
    bad satellite geometry, or you are somewhere without a good view of the sky, and you can only get
    a fix to within 500 feet, or not at all, you feel somehow cheated. In only a week of casual walking,
    driving, and flying around with a handheld GPS receiver, I got hooked on always knowing where I
    was, watching the position display change, and so forth. </p>
<p>In an open field or parking lot, it works great. You typically get your first fix less than a minute after
    turning on the receiver, and then, it tracks your position to an amazing degree of accuracy. Of
    course, did I really want to know that I walked to the mailbox 583 feet away at a heading of 47
    degrees with an average walking speed of 2.4 miles per hour? Sometimes it is possible to have too
    much information.</p>
<p>When you go inside, your receiver will probably lose most of the satellites it is tracking, until you
    put the receiver next to a window, where it can see the sky. If it can see enough satellites it will
    recalculate your position, although there is a good chance that you will have bad geometry (see
    Sidebar), because you can only see one direction from the window. Another thing which may
    prevent you from using the window is if it is covered with a thin metal film. Most office buildings use
    a reflective film on the windows to reduce solar heat loads (and for that &quot;mirror building look&quot;). The
    same film that blocks the heat of the sun also blocks the radio signals used by your GPS receiver. I
    tried to get a GPS fix in a hotel atrium, and it never did work, because of the film on the skylights.</p>
<p>It works great strapped to the handlebars of a bicycle with a bungee cord. In a car, it works great
    if you set it on the dashboard (some velcro or duct tape is handy to keep it from sliding off). The
    satellites are visible through the windshield. However, if you have some sort of metallic film over the
    windows, the film will probably block the GPS signals. All of the receivers have some sort of
    external antenna option to allow you to put the antenna outside, while the receiver is inside.</p>
<p>Trees don't seem to have much of an effect, although if you were in a torrential downpour, the
    water on the trees might have a shielding effect, particularly if the vegetation was very dense. GPS
    does work inside a tent in the rain.</p>
<p>If you are standing at the base of a cliff (or tall building), GPS may or may not work, depending on
    whether you can &quot;see&quot; the satellites. If you are very close to the cliff (a few feet), the receiver might
    pick up the signals reflecting from the cliff, rather than the direct signal, (just like &quot;ghosts&quot; on a fringe
    TV station) and give you a false position.</p>
<h4>Kinds of GPS receivers </h4>
<p>There are three basic kinds of GPS receivers available for non-military users. All of the receivers
    work with the same satellite system. The more expensive units are designed for a particular
    application, and often have features which allows the positions calculated by more than one
    receiver to be compared, giving much more accuracy. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Industrial units for surveying and data collection. These run from $5000 and up, and have a
        lot of features, lots of interfaces, and (with appropriate accessories) can provide accuracies
        to millimeters. Archaeologists mapping a site in hilly or forested terrain take note! They may
        be expensive, but these boxes are almost miraculous in their function, and can save an
        immense amount of time in mapping a complex site.
    </li>
    <li>Medium cost units intended for the marine and aviation market. They have functions aimed at
        steering your boat or plane, man overboard return, and things like that. These are typically in
        the few thousand dollar range, although the moving map display models cost substantially
        more. The marine versions have NMEA interfaces to hook up to your autopilot, depth
        sounder, etc. The aviation versions have the appropriate interfaces to connect to your
        avionics. Usually, they work primarily in latitude/longitude, and display speeds in knots and
        distances in nautical miles. Often, they include a &quot;canned library&quot; of locations, like airports,
        harbors, and so forth.
    </li>
    <li>The new breed of handheld units aimed at outdoorsmen, explorers, and so forth. They are
        relatively inexpensive ($700-$1500), provide outputs in a variety of units, and generally
        don't have external interfaces. These are the units reviewed in this article.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>With anything as technology oriented as a GPS receiver, there is a steady stream of &quot;new and
    improved&quot; models from the manufacturers. Newer models get a fix faster, use less battery power,
    weigh less, and (hopefully) are easier to use. By the time you read this, the models we describe
    may have been superseded by newer ones. The sophistication of the technology in a GPS receiver
    is similar to that in a cellular phone, so we can expect the prices of GPS receivers will probably
    drop as their popularity increases, just like the phones. It will probably be a couple of years before
    the handheld units get down to $300, though.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that almost all GPS receivers have the same basic accuracy, which is
    primarily determined by the where the satellites are when you get a fix (the geometry) and the
    inherent accuracy of the satellite signals. What differs is how long it takes to figure out your
    position, battery life, and what sort of user features are provided. Just like with any other type of
    electronic equipment, each manufacturer has added what they think is an essential set of features
    and capabilities. The way in which the makers distinguish themselves is by these &quot;bells and
    whistles&quot;. Whether a particular feature is important depends on if you are going to use it. For
    instance, some of the receivers feature a NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association)
    interface, which is really useful if you are hooking your GPS receiver up to your boat, but not much
    use in a backpack or airplane.</p>
<p>Here are some features that most receivers have, over and above the basic telling you where you
    are and what time it is:</p>
<h4>Satellite data </h4>
<p>All the receivers can tell you which satellites are being received, how good the signals are, and
    where the satellites are. Some are fancier than others, with graphic maps, and others with just
    numbers. In reality, the fancy display isn't necessary, since as long as the receiver tells you where
    you are, you don't care how it figured it out. Knowing what the direction is to each satellite is handy
    if you are having trouble receiving enough satellites, and want to figure out if something is blocking
    the signals.</p>
<h4>Storing fixes or locations: </h4>
<p>Typical GPS receivers can store 100-250 locations, which you can use later to plot positions on a
    map, or to use to retrace your steps (like the lost Inca gold in the example given earlier). You can
    store your current position (and time) into the unit's memory for later retrieval with a single button
    (often labelled Man Overboard, with obvious marine applications). You can also enter locations
    manually, say from a map or gazetteer, and later use the GPS unit to guide you to them.</p>
<h4>Navigate to stored location </h4>
<p>The receivers all provide a function in which the receiver gives you instructions on how to go to a
    previously entered location: turn left or right, and an indication of how far you have to go, as well as
    how fast you are moving right now. Some do this with a little picture that looks like a road you're
    supposed to follow, the others do it by giving you a steering indicator, like a needle on a compass.</p>
<h4>Trips and Routes </h4>
<p>The receivers allow you to enter a route or trip, defined as a series of locations (called waypoints)
    along the path. The receiver tracks your progress along the path and tells you how far off path you
    are, and whether to turn right or left to get back on the path. Usually, the receiver will tell you when
    you are expected to get to the end of the trip, assuming your speed remains constant. </p>
<h4>External antennas </h4>
<p>As we discussed before, GPS works by receiving signals from satellites in the sky. If you can't see
    the sky, you can't figure out where you are. This presents a real problem in a vehicle. Therefore, all
    of these units either have a detachable antenna and extension cable or an add-on external antenna,
    which you can put outside (using a magnet, suction cup, or the ubiquitous baling wire and duct
    tape), connected by a cable to the receiver which is inside. </p>
<h4>External interfaces </h4>
<p>The more expensive units have interfaces to external equipment, like a computer or autopilot.
    Depending on your needs, this may not be particularly useful (NMEA interfaces, the most common,
    are not directly compatible with most PC's).<br>
</p>
<h4>Adjustable receiver parameters </h4>
<p>Some receivers give the user the opportunity to adjust some of the receiver's operational
    parameters. These are the high tech equivalent of all the knobs on an expensive stereo. The
    problem is, unless you know a lot about GPS, and how the receiver works, you wouldn't have any
    idea how to set these values. However, if you are a GPS expert, you might want a receiver that lets
    you twiddle the knobs.</p>
<h3>Field Tests</h3>
<p>All well and good, from a theoretical standpoint. But what's really important is how well these little
    boxes work in the field. We asked the leading manufacturers to provide evaluation units for us to,
    well, evaluate. We didn't have a budget to go to the Amazon, or even Hawaii, for jungle testing, nor
    to the Andes for testing in the mountains, so we tested them in Southern California, where there are
    mountains, deserts, and jungles (of the urban sort).</p>
<p>Normally, reviews of high technology products have lots of comments about how the insides of the
    box work, and lots of esoteric detail, often designed to show the erudition of the review author. We
    feel that the user really doesn't care how it works, they only care if it works well, and does
    something useful. Therefore, we won't talk about how many channels the receiver has, or any other
    technical specs, except as they pertain to the overall usefulness of the unit. Call us up if you want to
    talk about esoteric details like early/late gate vs. tau dither loops, software channel multiplexing, and
    geodetic datums. The manufacturer's literature (copies on file at the club) also gives you all of this
    information, and more.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we focused on three basic areas of evaluation. The first is the issue of how long does
    it take the unit to get the first fix, and how well does it keep up with you after that. The second is
    battery life. The third is how well will it work in the field, actually being used to navigate or measure
    positions. </p>
<p>We have tried to give you a feel for what these GPS receivers can do, and what kinds of receivers
    are currently available. It is very important to go out and try the receiver you are thinking of buying.
    Hold it in your hand, press the buttons, walk around the parking lot with it, see if the display is
    readable, and so forth. Call the manufacturer to find out who stocks their receivers in your area
    (local marine and aviation supply places are a good bet).</p>
<h4>Environmental Ruggedness </h4>
<p>The units we reviewed are all designed for field use, and are relatively rugged and durable. They
    are all splashproof or waterproof, which is essential for field use. Not only might you need to use it
    in the rain, you would hate to have your moderately expensive receiver ruined by an unexpected
    dunking when the canoe overturns. Sure, there are lots of places you might want to go, like the
    Atacama desert where waterproofness is superfluous. Bear in mind that waterproof also means
    dustproof. You are more likely to encounter dust than water, and that fine, omnipresent grit is great
    at grinding away delicate electronic components. </p>
<p>Most of these units will work at any temperature where the user can work. They all use Liquid
    Crystal Displays (LCDs), which tend to fade and temporarily stop working in cold temperatures. If
    you get them cold enough, the liquid in the LCD may freeze, damaging the display (although not the
    rest of the receiver), so if you plan on taking one of these units to the top of Aconcagua, you will
    want to carry it inside your parka.</p>
<h4>How long does it take to get the first fix</h4>
<p>This is probably the primary difference between the receivers. When you turn your GPS receiver
    on, it has to scan for and lock onto the signals from the satellites that are currently in view. If the
    receiver can guess where it is and what time it is, it can use an internal almanac to figure out which
    satellites (of the 20 or more) are good candidates (i.e. above the horizon). If you are starting from
    scratch (i.e. you don't know where you are or what time it is), the receiver doesn't know which of
    the satellites might be in view, so it has to look for all 24 of them, one at a time, until it has enough
    to get a fix. This process can take 10 minutes or more. If the receiver knows which satellites are
    probably in view, it only has to scan for the signals from those satellites, which generally takes
    about 30 seconds to a minute.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you only have to do the long satellite search if you have travelled a long way (like
    Miami to Lima on a plane), or if the batteries have been removed for a while (even &quot;dead&quot; batteries
    have a little juice left, enough to keep the receiver's memory intact). Most receivers have a
    provision where you can tell it approximately where you are and what time it is, which speeds up
    the long search process.</p>
<p>Once the receiver is locked onto a set of satellites and has calculated your position, it can calculate
    a new position almost instantly (typically less than a second). The receiver continuously monitors
    the signals from the satellites, and when they get weak or disappear (like if the satellite has gone
    below the horizon), it scans for a new satellite(s) to lock on to. This is especially important when
    you are in a valley or an urban environment, where cliffs or buildings block the signals from the
    satellites as you move around.</p>
<p>Satellite acquisition and tracking is where clever design on the part of the manufacturer can make a
    big difference. There are lots of ways to go about searching for good satellites, and also how to
    anticipate when to switch off to a new one. Everybody has their own technique and design,
    manifested as different performance under the same satellite configuration. It gets particularly tricky
    if you want to make the whole system low powered.</p>
<h4>Battery life.</h4>
<p>If you are going to be trusting your navigation to a device which runs off of electricity, you had
    better make sure you have electricity when you need it. All of these portable receivers use batteries
    for power. The burning question becomes, how long do those batteries last? Am I going to have to
    carry a hundred pounds of AA batteries, just to find out where I am?</p>
<p>We used a mountain of batteries and drained them flat when testing these receivers. Better that we
    should run out of batteries across the street from Kmart than you should in the jungle outback. Do
    the manufacturers tell the truth when giving battery life specs? </p>
<p>It varies. They will all run for well over the minimum time given, but it's probably pretty hard to get
    the absolute maximum. It turns out that a lot of battery life is determined by the user's habits. Do
    you always use the backlight for the display (it typically draws a lot of power)? Do you use the fast
    fix mode? Just how fresh were those batteries, anyway? Is it really cold out (below freezing,
    alkaline batteries lose their power)?</p>
<p>In expedition slogging, where you are trekking towards a goal and you just want to find where you
    are occasionally, you don't need to leave the receiver on. When you need a location fix, turn the
    receiver on, wait the minute for it to find the satellites, and record the position. Then turn it off. If
    you do this once an hour, a receiver with a paltry 4 hour battery life (they are all better than that)
    will work for 10 days. If you use this mode of operation the &quot;time to first fix&quot; is important, since
    once you have that first fix, you will probably turn the unit off.</p>
<p>In an continuous navigation mode, where you are holding the receiver in front of you like a
    compass, the battery life issue changes to how much power does the unit draw while it is running
    continously. Some receivers, like the Trimble Scout, have a mode where most of the electronics
    (except the display) is turned off, except for every 5 seconds when it takes a fix. There is also
    usually an option that just turns the receiver off automatically after a preset interval (like 15 minutes)
    with no button pushes, if you forget to do it yourself.</p>
<p>If you are going to be doing a lot of travelling in a vehicle, an external power adapter would be a
    good investment. That way, you can run off the car battery forever, without running down those
    AA batteries. For extended field use you can get portable rechargeable 12 Volt batteries. You
    could even use NiCd rechargeables, and recharge them with a solar panel.</p>
<h4>Specifics</h4>
<p><u>Trimble Scout (list price $795)</u></p>
<p>This is a new model from Trimble Navigation, who was an early pioneer in low cost GPS receivers.
    Based on their earlier Ensign models, it weighs about 14 oz (with batteries), and is a slim curved
    handheld unit with a very nice feel. The antenna is built in to the top of the case. The Scout uses a
    eight buttons to cycle through a series of menus on its 4 line LCD display.</p>
<p>Unlike the Ensign, which was a marine unit, the Scout is designed for use on land. The slickest
    feature is the the ability to display and enter positions in a whole host of formats, as opposed to just
    Lat/Lon or UTM. For instance, if you tell it the map scale, you can display and enter positions as
    inches or centimeters on the map relative to a known location (like the corner of the map). For
    users who are in the United States, it comes with a complete road atlas, and will give you positions
    as page and grid in the atlas, or as detailed page and grid for the Thomas Brothers series of city
    street atlases (in Los Angeles, this feature alone would pay for a Scout if you were always getting
    lost). It can also tell you the phase of the moon (and where it will be) for any date, time, or position,
    which you might be able to use for predicting eclipses, should it prove useful in encounters with
    primitive, but aggressive, natives.</p>
<p>Trimble has chosen an overall philosophy of emphasizing user needs and functions, as opposed to
    the technology. You don't get a lot of options to set filter parameters, manually select satellites, etc.
    That is all buried inside the unit. What you do get is dozens of ways to display your position, in
    convenient units. Overall, most users will find this a boon, since they really don't care about the
    esoterica of GPS, but don't want to have to interpolate between grid lines on a map.</p>
<p>The manual is clear and well organized. It doesn't go into too much detail about how GPS works,
    but concentrates on using the Scout. If you need to know how it works, Trimble publishes a very
    good 80 page booklet about how GPS works. When you first pick up the unit, you need to spend
    a few minutes getting used to how the menus are arranged, and how you use the &quot;cursor keys&quot; to
    select menu items, but once you have done that, it is quite easy to use. Entering numbers and letters
    is a little bit of a pain, since you have to use the cursor keys to step through A-Z,0-9, and
    punctuation. A little practice makes this fairly fast though.</p>
<p>Pros: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Displays position in just about any units you want, including inches on a map.</li>
    <li>Fast acquisition</li>
    <li>Light weight</li>
    <li>Sunrise/set (moon too)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons: </p>
<ul>
    <li>No external interface</li>
    <li>Learning the menus takes a few minutes, and it isn't always as convenient as you might want.</li>
    <li>Altitude display rounded to 100 ft, even if satellite positions allow better accuracy</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Garmin GPS-75 Personal Navigator (list price $1419)</u></p>
<p>This receiver looks like a slighly overgrown Walkman in size and weight (about 19 oz with
    batteries) , and has a graphic LCD display, as well as a 20 key keypad. It has a cylindrical antenna
    (which you are supposed to aim vertically) attached to the side of the case by a pivot. The GPS-75
    is a newer, more sophisticated version of Garmin's GPS-50 ($1195), which was primarily a marine
    product, and which does not have the graphic display.</p>
<p>The graphic display is really the Garmin's best feature. It is clear and sharp, and has a really neat
    feature which displays a map of your selected route, as well as your actual path along the route.
    The Garmin, just like all the other receivers, uses a series of menus to control operation, enter
    waypoints, and so forth. It has a numeric keypad, which simplifies entering numeric coordinates.
    The GPS-75 can display positions in lat/lon coordinates, UTM coordinates, as well as British and
    Irish Grid.</p>
<p>A unique feature of the Garmin receiver is that you can enter up to 9 &quot;proximity waypoints&quot; which
    cause an alarm to sound if you are within a user specified distance of them. In marine applications,
    this is used to warn of rocks or reefs, but there are probably similar land based applications.</p>
<p>The Garmin has a whole slew of features to display charts and graphs of where the satellites are,
    how strong the signals are, and so forth. However, in practice, most users don't really care about
    this, only wanting to know where they are or where their destination is.</p>
<p>The GPS-75 has an external interface built in which can talk to NMEA compatible marine
    electronics, as well as receiving differential corrections, which can improve the accuracy of the
    position it calculates to within a few feet. The external interface can take any DC power from 5 to
    40 Volts (like 12V from a car battery), and can also sound an external alarm when certain
    conditions are met (loss of satellite lock, closeness to preset locations, etc.) </p>
<p>The GPS-75 acquires within 2 minutes for a 2D fix, although a special &quot;warmstart&quot; mode gets a fix
    in 15 seconds. The 4 AA batteries should last 5 hours in normal mode, and 7 hours in power saver
    mode. As always, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>The manual is fairly complete, providing a lot of information on how to use the GPS-75, with
    diagrams and pictures for the most common operations. However, it seems that for many of the
    more sophisticated features, the description of how to use it is somewhat sketchy. Also, there isn't
    a whole lot of information about what to do when things go wrong. Sure, it's nice to know that you
    have &quot;Degraded Accuracy&quot;, but some helpful hints about what to do might be useful.</p>
<p>Pros: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Graphic display of route and track</li>
    <li>Relatively light weight</li>
    <li>Display looks really good</li>
    <li>Sunrise/set</li>
    <li>Numeric Keypad</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Limited display options for position (lat lon, utm)</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Magellan GPS NAV 5000D (List price $1299)</u></p>
<p>The Magellan receiver is the largest and heaviest of the lot we reviewed (a little less than 2 lbs, with
    batteries). It has a group of function keys above a numeric keypad, and a 4 line LCD display. The
    antenna is a sort of rectangular box attached with a pivot to the side of the unit. This receiver is
    representative of the previous generation of handheld GPS units. Magellan is coming out with a new
    model, the Trailblazer, in the fall of 1993, which I'll talk about at the end of this section.</p>
<p>In all, the 5000D has basically the same accuracy as other GPS units, it has the usual features to
    remember waypoints, plan trips, and guide you along a stored route. It has an external NMEA
    interface to connect to various marine electronics. One feature of the 5000D, as opposed to the
    ordinary 5000, is that it has the capability to receive &quot;differential corrections&quot; from another special
    GPS receiver, which results in corrected positions accurate to about 3-10 feet.</p>
<p>A useful feature of the 5000D is that it can calculate a satellite availability schedule for a specified
    location and date, telling you if there are any times that you might not be able to get a full 3D, or
    even a 2D fix. It takes 4 satellites in view to get a 3D fix, and due to satellite failures or your
    location, it is possible (although unlikely) that not enough satellites will be visible.</p>
<p>The manual for the 5000D is very well written, and has a helpful section with troubleshooting and
    operating tips. It shows a picture of the message on the screen, and tells you what to do to fix it.
    The manual shows the NAV 5000's marine orientation, as most, if not all, of the examples are
    related to sailing a boat.</p>
<p>The 5000D is rated to take 55 seconds to first fix from a cold start and 35 seconds from a warm
    start (last fix was less than an hour ago, and still using same satellites), however, it always seemed
    to take longer than that for us when we were testing. The 6 AA batteries should last 10 hours of
    continuous use. The 5000D comes with an external interface/power cable to connect to NMEA
    devices.</p>
<p>Pros: </p>
<ul>
    <li>External Interface</li>
    <li>It floats</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Slow acquisition</li>
    <li>Only displays in Latitude/Longitude</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as this article was being finished up, I found that Magellan is releasing their version of a
    lightweight handheld GPS receiver called the Trailblazer. The Trailblazer weighs less than a pound,
    and runs for 4 hours minimum on 3 AA batteries. It has a very handy feature which turns most of
    the receiver off, except every 10 minutes when it wakes up, takes a fix, and stores it in memory.
    You can then select a &quot;backtrack&quot; mode which will guide you back along those saved positions. It
    displays positions in lat/lon or UTM, and comes with an external interface. Best of all, Magellan
    expects it to sell for about $500. Look for this unit when it comes out.</p>
<p><u>Other receivers we didn't have a chance to review</u></p>
<p>Of course, there are other manufacturers of handheld GPS receivers. We haven't reviewed them in
    detail, either because we couldn't find anything out about them or because we couldn't get an
    evaluation unit from the manufacturer before the deadline for this article. GPS is a new technology,
    and many of the manufacturers are having trouble figuring out where to position it and which
    division should handle their GPS products. This makes tracking down information a little bit
    difficult. </p>
<p>Motorola has a unit called the Traxar which is priced in the $700-800 range, which has been out
    for about a year. It weighs 19 ounces and is about 4 x 8 x 1 1/2 inches. The Traxar uses 6 AA
    batteries, which should last 6 hours. It is primarily a marine unit with the low end unit displaying in
    lat/lon only (the Traxar MG+ can also display in UTM/UPS coordinates). Motorola sells a &quot;Smart
    Bracket&quot; which provides a NMEA interface and external power. It is sold through marine
    distributors, as well as some catalog outlets (e.g. L.L. Bean). The Motorola unit has a 3 year
    warranty and toll-free technical support.</p>
<p>Sony has a relatively sophisticated unit, the Pyxis IPS-720, which has a graphic display, and
    appears to be aimed at the marine and aviation markets, since they will have little memory cards
    with chart data preprogrammed in it available. You will probably see Sony's original GPS offering,
    the Pyxis IPS-360 in the discounter catalogs for about $500. It may seem like a good deal, but it is
    reputed to have very short battery life, and take forever to get a first fix. The Trimble Scout or
    Magellans Trailblazer are much better units at the same or slightly more money. </p>
<p>ICOM, better known for handheld radios and amateur gear, also has a GPS receiver, however,
    after seeing it once at a marine supply store, we haven't been able to find out anything about it.</p>
<p><u>Which one do I like?</u></p>
<p>My personal opinion, based primarily on gut feel, favors the Trimble Scout. It's cheap, it looks real
    cool, it's lightweight, and it displays positions in a wide variety of formats, including inches on a
    map. It would be nice if it had an external interface, but you can't ask for everything, and there will
    probably be a model that has that option soon. The other units provide more information about
    where the satellites are (with neat little graphs in the case of the Garmin unit), however, I would
    rather have the plethora of ways to display my position, like the Scout does. The &quot;moving map&quot; on
    the Garmin GPS-75 is pretty neat, but isn't much use on land, where you are usually constrained to
    a road or trail.</p>
<p>The Magellan Trailblazer, due out in fall 1993, looks very interesting, and apparently competes
    directly against the Trimble Scout. I'll be waiting to see what it looks like and how it works.</p>
