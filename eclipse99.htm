<h2>Total Eclipse of 11 August 1999, Salzburg, Austria </h2>
<p>We travelled to Salzburg Austria to view the eclipse, and were very fortunate. 
  All around us the clouds were quite solid. In fact, it was raining early in 
  the morning. I had been watching the news from about 5AM (the eclipse was midday), 
  and it was pouring rain in Stuttgart and Munich, which were to the west of us. 
  The TV broadcasts of those panoramic cameras at the various resorts and in the 
  big cities are a big help, especially in getting a feel for the overall weather 
  patterns in the days before the eclipse.</p>

      and 20 minutes before totality.</td>

<p>We had strategized that we might want to drive to somewhere a hole would appear, 
  but, a hole looked like it would move over us (based on earlier day's observations 
  of thunderstorms moving over from Bavaria). So we gambled and stayed put at 
  our hotel, the Schoene Aussicht, on a hill just outside town. At first contact, 
  as the moon began to move over the sun, there was broken cleared coverage, which 
  rapidly cleared to a hole over most of the sky.</p>

      watchers gathered on our hilltop. Photo about 50 minutes before totality.</td>

  <tr>
    <td width="63%">After anxiously waiting, totality occurred right on schedule, 
      starting with a nice &quot;diamond ring&quot;. The lens (a 70-210 zoom with 
      a 2x teleconverter) has a lot of flare, causing some ghost images.</td>

    <td width="79%">By now, I've gotten pretty blase about pictures of the sun 
      during totality (others take better quality images), but, one of the neatest 
      things is the quality of the light and the glow around the horizon. It's 
      not obvious in the picture, but the distant mountains are actually still 
      in the sunlight, even though we are in the shadow.</td>

      exposures. The one to the left has more prominence detail, the one to the 
      right better detail on the corona</td>

    <td>After totality, the sunlight comes back, and people rush on their way. 
      A few more looks through the filter at the mostly covered sun, and it is 
      off to lunch.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>A few hours later, we were back to the usual Salzburg weather: Afternoon thunderstorms. 
  Checking the newspapers the following day, it looks like Salzburg was one of 
  the few places in Europe which had really clear weather from first contact through 
  totality. Pity the poor folk in Cornwall, who got to watch it raining.</p>
