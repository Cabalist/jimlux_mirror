<h3>Reasons not to use wirewound resistors beyond their ratings</h3>
<p>At first glance, the readily available wirewound power
    resistor appears to be a good solution to inexpensive high
    voltage resistor requirements. The breakdown voltage is typically
    several kilovolts per inch of length, so a 100 watt resistor 6
    inches long will probably work at 20 kV, particularly for an
    application where the substantial inductance isn't a problem.
    However, in systems where there is a lot of stored energy, the
    failure mode for these resistors can cause catastrophic damage to
    other components.</p>
<p>A wirewound resistor is made by winding a very fine resistance
    element (e.g. Nichrome) on a ceramic form. If a small open
    develops (the typical failure mode, either due to a physical
    impact deforming or severing the wire, or due to excessive power
    disspation) an arc will form at the gap, melting the wire back,
    making the arc bigger. This is a continuing process that can be
    quite spectacular.</p>
