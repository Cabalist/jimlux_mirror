<h2>Current Measurement</h2>
<p>Small currents in HV circuitry can be measured by the usual means, resistors 
  across which the voltage is measured or transformers. The challenge is usually 
  in finding a way to isolate the measurement circuit so that it can &quot;float&quot; 
  at the high voltage, although, with modern fiber optic techniques this is less 
  of a problem. Often, just mounting a conventional meter in an insulating clear 
  box is sufficient. An optical telescope can be used to read the meter from a 
  distance.</p>
<p>For large, pulsed, currents however, the challenge is substantially greater. 
  The methods essentially fall into two general categories: 1) measuring the voltage 
  drop across a resistor; and 2) measuring the magnetic field that inevitably 
  accompanies a current. The latter is typically done either by using a sensing 
  coil, or more recently, by using a hall effect sensor. Another approach is to 
  use the Faraday rotation effect to sense the field optically.</p>
<h3>Resistive Voltage Drop Approaches</h3>
<p> Measuring the voltage drop across a resistor (and using Ohm's Law) is often 
  referred to as a &quot;current shunt&quot;, deriving from the common usage where 
  a low resistance is connected in parallel with a higher resistance meter, with 
  the values chosen so that the current flowing through the meter is some convenient 
  fraction (i.e. 1/100th) of the total current.</p>
<p>There are a number of problems with shunts in high current pulsed applications, 
  although, the simplicity of the approach is appealing.</p>
<p>The resistance is typically very small (0.001 ohms would produce 1 volt/kA): 
  you want the voltage drop to be conveniently measurable; and, you don't want 
  to dissipate a lot of energy in the resistor (.001 ohms dissipates 1 kW at 1 
  kA... that Isquared term adds up..). Measuring and calibrating such tiny resistances 
  is difficult.</p>
<p>The resistance varies as a function of temperature and mechanical mounting 
  stress. Some of the temperature effects can be handled by calibration: measuring 
  the resistance at various temperatures. However, this assumes that the entire 
  resistor is at thermal equilibrium, which is rarely the case. As the pulse goes 
  through the resistor, it will heat up (that kW..), and different parts will 
  heat at different rates. Over time the heat diffuses through the structure, 
  some radiates away, some is convectively transferred, making knowing exactly 
  what the temperature of any part (and, hence its resistance) is very difficult. 
  Mechanical mounting stress causes errors by changing the dimensions and contact 
  resistances in the resistor.</p>
<p>Magnetic effects cause problems. One of the most troublesome is the propagation 
  of the field into the conductor: skin effect. This can be mitigated to a certain 
  amount by making the resistive element a loop or coaxial, and, in any event, 
  can theoretically be calibrated out with precision measurements at low power. 
  Another, less obvious, source of problems is deformation of the resistor by 
  the high fields, which can stretch and bend the conductors. The series inductance 
  of the resistor may also perturb the behavior of the system. <a href="loopshunt.htm">More 
  design information for loop shunts</a>.</p>
<p>The foregoing may make it seem that anything would be better than a resistor. 
  However, for a vast number of applications, the simplicity of resistive techniques 
  makes them attractive. If all you need is 5% accuracy, then obsessive attention 
  to temperature coefficients, and so forth, will be moot.</p>
