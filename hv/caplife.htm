<h2>Expected Life of Pulse Discharge Capacitors</h2>

<p>Pulse discharge operation, particularly with underdamped
    (ringing) discharges, places large internal stresses on
    components. Empirical expressions have been developed to predict
    the life of a pulse discharge capacitor under conditions other
    than the nominal design. For instance, in an article by K.
    Salisbury, S. Lloyd, and Y.G. Chen at Maxwell Laboratories,
    &quot;A transportable 50 KA Dual Mode Lightning Simulator&quot;,
    the following equation is given.</p>

<p>Lx = Lref * (Qref/Qx)^1.6 * (Vref/Vx)^7.5</p>

<p>where<br>
    x subscript refers to the application<br>
    ref subscript refers to the reference data<br>
    L is the expected life (in shots),<br>
    Q is the discharge waveform Q<br>
    V is the capacitor charge voltage.</p>

<p>Note that capacitor voltage is the most important life
    determinant, with a 7.5 exponent. A little reduction in voltage
    leads to a huge increase in life.</p>

<p>Voltage reversal also has a significant impact. When the
    voltage reverses, the mechanical stresses on the capacitor are
    quite high. </p>

<h3>Application Example</h3>

<p>For instance, a Maxwell type 31162, is rated at 100,000 shots
    at 75 kV with 20% VR. (20% VR is Q = 1.4)</p>

<p>Now, we want to know the life in a Tesla coil at 90% reversal
    (a Q of 15) and a peak voltage of 42 kV. Applying the above
    formula:</p>

<p>Lx = 1E5 * ( 1.4/15)^1.6 * (75/42)^7.5 = 1E5 * .0225 * 77.37 =
    1.74E5 shots.</p>

<p>reducing the voltage to 30 kV would increase the life by
    (42/30)^7.5 or 12.5 times.</p>

<p>If this were in a Tesla coil at 120 bps, at 42 kV, it would
    survive (90% probability) about 24 minutes of run time. Reducing
    the voltage to 30 kV would increase the life to 300 minutes, or 5
    hours. Reducing the peak voltage to 20 kV is even more effective,
    increasing the life to 100 hours. Killing the Q down to 10 would
    increase the life by (15/10)^1.6 some 90 percent.</p>

<p>Capacitors rated for high repetition rates are necessarily
    overdesigned. Comparing two units from Maxwell Labs:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1.0 uF 40 kV 1pps 1E5 shots 2.3x5.9x27.8 inches</li>
    <li>0.1 uF 40 kV 1000 pps 1E8 shots 2.3x5.9x14.8 inches</li>
</ul>

<p>If the high reprate capacitor (with a 1000 times the life)
    were scaled to the capacity of the low rep rate unit, it would be
    about 5 times the size of the low rep rate unit. A life factor of
    1000 can be achieved by increasing the rated voltage by about 2.5
    times. This would require about 6.25 times the total capacitance
    arranged in a series parallel configuration, which correlates
    well with the physical size increase factor of 5.</p>

<h3>Q and Voltage Reversal</h3>

<p><em>(these need to be verified, particularly at low Q's)</em></p>

<p>Q or voltage reversal (VR) may be computed from each other by:</p>

<p>Q = sqrt( 1 + 1 /( 2 /pi*ln(VR))^2)</p>

<p>VR = exp( - pi/2 * sqrt(1/(q^2-1)))</p>

<p>where VR is the voltage reversal expressed as a fraction (i.e.
    0&lt;VR&lt;1)</p>
