<h2>Litzendraht Wire</h2>
<p>Litzendraht Wire (Litz wire) is a bundle of multiple insulated strands which,
    in theory, has lower ac resistance than a single strand of the same cross sectional
    area. This is due to the reduction of the skin effect (i.e. the current of an
    ac signal doesn't penetrate all the way into a conductor), but is limited by
    the mutual coupling between the strands. Much of the text below is taken from
    the NBS Circular 74, and there are some more links at the bottom. </p>
<p><i>Resistance ratio</i> is the ratio between the AC resistance and the DC resistance.
    It is always &gt;=1. My comments are in <i>italics</i>.</p>
<p>From p 306, NBS Circular 74</p>
<h3>Stranded Wire</h3>
<p>The use of conductors consisting of a number of fine wires to reduce the skin
    effect is common. The resistance ratio for a stranded conductor is, however,
    always considerably larger than the value calculated by Table 19, p 311, and
    Table 17, p309 for a single one of the strands. Only when the strands are at
    impracticably large distances from one another is this condition even approximately
    realized.</p>
<p>Formulas have been propesd for calculating the reistance ratio of starnded
    conductors, but although they enable qualitatively correct conclusions to be
    drawn as to the effect of changing the frequency and some of the other variables,
    they do not give numerical values which agree at all closely with experiment.
    The cause for this lies, probably, to a large extent in the importance of small
    changes in the arrangement of the strands. The following general statements
    will serve as a rough guide as to what may be expected for the order of magnitude
    of the resitance ratio as an aid in design, but when a precise knowledge of
    the resistance ratio is required in any given case it should be measured. (See
    methods given in sections 46 to 50.)</p>
<h4>Bare Strands in Contact</h4>
<p>The resistance ratio of <i>n</i> strands of bare wire placed parallel and making
    contact with one another is found by experiment to be the same as for a round
    solid wire which has the same area of cross section as the sum of the cross
    sectional areas of the strands; that is, <i>n</i> times the cross section of
    a single strand. <i>[note this doesn't say that the resistance is n times, it
        is the resistance ratio we are tallking about here. The DC resistance will be
        R/n, where R is the resistance of a single strand. What this says is that the
        AC resistance will be, generally, R, so that Rac/Rdc (n parallel bare strands)
        = n * Rac/Rdc (single strand). ]</i> This will be essentially the case in conductors
    that are in contact and are poorly insulated, except that at high frequencies
    the additional loss of energy due to heating of the imperfect contacts by the
    passage of the current from one strand to another may raise the <i>[ac]</i>
    resistance still higher.</p>
<p><i>Note also that if the lengths of the strands, or their spacings, start to
    be a significant fraction of a wavelength, simple analysis is impossible.</i></p>
<p>Insulated Strands</p>
<p>As the distance between the strands is increased, the resistance ratio falls,
    rapidly at first, and then more slowly toward the limit which holds for a single
    isolated strand. A very moderate thickness of insulation between the strands
    will quite materially reduce the resistance ratio, provided conduction in the
    dielectric is negligible.</p>
<p>Spiraling or twisting the strands has the effect of increasing the resistance
    ratio slightly, the distance between the strands being unchanged.</p>
<p>Transposition of the strands so that each takes up successively all possible
    positions in the cross section - as for example, by thorough braiding - reduces
    the resitance ratio but not so low as the value for a single strand.</p>
<p>Twisting together conductors, each of which is made up of a number of strands
    twisted together, the resulting composite conductor being twisted together with
    other similar composite conductors, etc.[<i>much like large steel cables</i>
    <i>-jl</i>], is a common method for transposing the strands in the cross section.
    Such conductors do not have a resistance ratio very much different from a simple
    bundle of well-insulated strands.</p>
<p>The most efficient method of transposition is to combine the strands in a holow
    tube of basket weave. Such a conductor is naturally more costly than other forms
    of stranded conductor.</p>
<h4>Effect of Number of Strands</h4>
<p>With respect to the choice of the number of strands, experiment shows that
    the absolute rise of the resistance in ohms depends on the diameter of a single
    strand, but is independent of the number of strands. Since, however, the direct-current
    resistance of the conductor is smaller the greater the number of strands, the
    resistance ratio is greater the greater the number of strands. Reducing the
    diameter of the strands reduces the resistance ratio, the number of strands
    remaining unchanged, but to obtain a given current-carrying capacity, or a small
    enough total resistance, the total cross section must not be lowered below a
    certain limit, so that, in general, reducing the diameter of the strands means
    an increase in the number of strands.</p>

<p><i>[- here i have paraphrased the original text in the circular - ]</i></p>
<p>p308, Circular 74</p>
<p><i>To calculate the order of magnitude of the resistance ratio considering
    a composite of enameled strands of 0.07 mm diameter (ca 41-42 ga) twisted together.</i></p>
<p><i>Calculate the resistance ratio for a single strand at the desired frequency
    (it will be close to 1, with such fine wire).</i></p>
<p><i>Calculate the resistance ratio for a single strand with the same area (that
    is, the diameter is D * SQRT(N), where D is the diameter of a single strand,
    and N is the number of wires)</i></p>
<p><i>[end paraphrase]</i></p>
<p>The resistance ratio for the composite stranded wire (for moderate frequencies)
    will be about 1/4 to 1/3 of the way between the two values. This holds for straight
    wires up to higher frequencies than for solenoids. (See critical frequncy mentioned
    in second paragraph below) Not all so-called Litzendraht is as good as this
    by any means.For a woven tube, the ratio may be as close as 1/10 of the way
    from the lower to the higher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Coils of stranded wire</h4>
<p>For coils wound with stranded conductors, the resistance ratio is always larger
    than for the straight conductor, and at high frequencies may be two or three
    times as great. It is appreciably greater for a very short coil than for a long
    solenoid. </p>
<p>For moderate frequencies the resistance ratio is less than for a similar coil
    of solid wire of the same cross section as just stated, but for every strnaded-conductor
    coil there is a critical frequency above which the stranded conductor has the
    larger resistance ratio. This critical frequecny lies higher, the finer the
    strands and the smaller their number. For 100 strands of say 0.07 mm diameter,
    this limit lies above the more usual radio frequencies [<i>in 1937 - jl</i>].</p>
<p>This supposes that losses in the dielectric are not important, which is the
    case for single layer coils with strands well insulated. In multiple layer coils
    of stranded wire, dielectric losses are not negligble at high frequencies.</p>
