<h2>Capacitor Discharge Impulse Generators</h2>
<p>This is the simplest means of generating a high voltage
    impulse in a load. Practical considerations usually dictate that
    more sophisticated means be used (like <a href="marx.htm">Marx
        generators</a>, Transmission line pulse formers, Impulse
    transformers, etc.), but the basic capacitor discharge circuit is
    a good place to start.</p>
<p><img src="images/cdimp.gif" width="413" height="119"></p>
<p>The circuit above has all the essential components:</p>
<p>Echg - A means of charging the capacitor. Often, either a
    current limited HV power supply and a switch to connect it to the
    capacitor, or a HV power supply and a large series resistor to
    limit the charging current.</p>
<p>Cs - A capacitor to store the energy.</p>
<p>S - A switch to apply the energy to the load</p>
<p>R1 and L Series resistance and/or inductance, either parasitic
    or added for pulse shape control</p>
<p>R2 - Load resistance</p>
<p>Cload - Load capacitance</p>
<h3>Waveforms and the effect of resistances and inductances</h3>
<p>Assuming the parasitic inductances are small (often, this is
    not a valid assumption), the output of a capacitive impulse
    generator can be represented by a pair of exponentials,
    reflecting the charging of the load capacitance and then, the
    discharge of the storage and load capacitance. The most common
    way to describe the waveform is by it's rise and fall times.</p>
<p>A standard waveform for lightning impulse testing would be a
    2/50, where the load voltage reaches its peak in 2 microseconds,
    and the decay to half the peak voltage takes 50 microseconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Energy Discharge Capacitors</h3>
<p>In these systems, the capacitor is used to store the energy to
    be used for the impulse. Since fast rise times are usually
    desired, the capacitor should have low parasitic inductance.
    Resistive losses also result in lower efficiency and slower rise
    times. Commercial energy storage capacitors are designed to a
    specific capacitance. The manufacturer then tests them, and their
    actual characteristics (capacitance, stored energy) are marked on
    the label.</p>
<h3>Switches</h3>
<p>The switches for an impulse generator fall into two general
    categories. The first is those that are primarily mechanical in
    nature, consisting of contacts that are closed by some means such
    as a spring, solenoid, air cylinder, or other actuator. The
    second is those that have no moving parts, with the triggered
    spark gap being very popular, although in some applications,
    devices such as thyratrons or SCR's are used.</p>
<h3>Capacitor Charging considerations</h3>
<p>The rectified output of a high voltage transformer is probably
    the simplest system used for charging the capacitor. Some form of
    current limiting is necessary because the capacitor looks like a
    dead short when fully discharged. The current limiting is often
    in the form of a series impedance. The impedance be either
    inductive or resistive and can either be in the primary side of
    the transformer or the secondary (or be in sort of both, in the
    form of leakage inductance in the transformer).</p>
<p>A resistive current limiter is simple, but the energy
    dissipated in the resistor is signficant, being equal to the
    stored energy in the capacitor. Inductive current limiters don't
    have the power dissipation problem of a resistor, but are more
    susceptible to unwanted resonance effects, particularly with
    parasitic reactances. A resonant charging scheme using a diode
    and an inductor is very popular for capacitor discharge circuits
    that are fired repeatedly.</p>
<p>Fruengel recommends the use of a voltage multipler
    (Cockroft-Walton type), because it has a hyperbolic
    voltage/current characteristic that lends itself to capacitor
    charging. The disadvantage is that there is significant stored
    energy in the capacitor stack of the multiplier, although raising
    the input frequency reduces the size of capacitor required, and
    the stored energy. In fact, a logical outgrowth of this trend is
    the use of switching power supplies.</p>
<h4>Switchers as capacitor chargers</h4>
<p>In recent years, switching power supplies have become popular
    for capacitor charging. The generally high (tens of kHz)
    switching frequency reduces the stored energy in the supply,
    which enhances safety and reduces the chances of a flashover arc
    developing. They can provide a constant charging current,
    reducing the power lost compared to a series resistor RC scheme.
    They can also detect faults and shut down the supply if an arc
    develops or a capacitor fails (shorted) during charging. HV power
    supply manufacturers such as Maxwell have power supplies designed
    specifically for charging capacitors.</p>
<h4>Watch out for voltage reversals during discharge</h4>
<p>The system for charging should take into account the voltage
    reversal on the storage capacitor if any. For instance, a
    currrent limited HV transformer feeding a bridge rectifier is a
    convenient way to charge a capacitor. However, if the capacitor
    discharge waveform has any voltage reversal, the diodes in the
    bridge will be forward biased in parallel with the capacitor, and
    the resulting high peak currents will most likely destroy the
    diodes.</p>
