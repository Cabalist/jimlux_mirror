<p>Thoughts on advanced modeling of sparks and toploads</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple TC model which has stood the test of time is pretty simple. The
    coupled LC resonators, with the top load modeled as a single capacitor, and
    an empirical model of the spark as a 220k resistor with a several pF capacitor.
    The spark model was developed by Terry Fritz on the TCML in around 2001/2002
    by adjusting a SPICE model to match measured data on a test coil, based on some
    discussions on the TCML back in June 1998.</p>

<p>While this model seems to replicate the primary/secondary behavior as far as
    currents and voltages pretty well, it doesn't necessarily give much insight
    into what makes big sparks. That is, there is obviously some fairly complex
    interaction between the growth of the spark and the flow of charge into the
    topload from the secondary inductor. If for no other reason, the physical topload
    is often on the order of a meter across, and it takes finite time for the charge
    to flow from one side to the other to support the leader growth. For this reason,
    I propose a somewhat more complex model of the spark and the topload.</p>
<p>First, a model of the spark. Based on the discussion in Bazelyan and Raizer
    (Spark Discharge, CRC Press, 1998), I think the spark can be modeled as a gradually
    growing distributed R and C. As described in B&amp;R, a leader grows by charge
    flowing through the spark channel accumulating at the leader head, which they
    suggest might be effectively modeled as a 1 cm sphere. Eventually, enough charge
    accumulates so that the field on that sphere exceeds the local breakdown strength
    of the air (30kV/cm), and a new extension of the channel occurs. The current
    flowing in the channel also serves to keep the channel hot and conductive, in
    the face of radiative and conduction cooling. As long as charge is available
    to extend the channel, the spark will continue to grow:which is how a multi-meter
    spark can bridge a distance where the average field is only a few kV/meter,
    well below the 3MV/meter breakdown for air. In the diagram below, I've indicated
    spark gaps, but in actuality, I think it would be modeled as a conditional statement
    in some lines of code, not as trying to actually model a spark gap. Likewise
    the spark channel is shown as a sort of lossy transmission line RLC, but in
    reality, some time varying model like that of Goncz is probably more appropriate.</p>

<p>The challenge is, of course, in choosing appropriate values for the resistance,
    the capacitance, and the &quot;jump distance&quot; or &quot;modeling increment
    size&quot;. The capacitance can probably be selected based on data in B&amp;R..
    it will be on the order of a few pF/meter. Likewise, the inductance is on the
    order of 1 uH/meter. Resistive losses in the channel can also be estimated from
    the well known properties of sparks with the measured current in the sparks.
    (e.g. the measurements made by Greg Leyh on Electrum, or data on free burning
    arcs from Somerville or Cobine). The jump length might be best estimated by
    using the known propagation velocity of a spark, around 2-3 m/microsecond.</p>
<p>It's also true that on the scale of the spark channel, the top load cannot
    be considered as a point source capacitor, but rather, it's time domain properties
    must be considered, perhaps as a network of transmission lines or distributed
    LC networks. There should be some sort of FDTD Transmission Line model (after
    Yee) that would be suitable.</p>
