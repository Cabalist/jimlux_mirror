<h3>Rotary Spark Gaps</h3>
<p>Many high voltage systems have a need for a repetitive
    switching action at fairly slow rates, i.e. less than 1000 per
    second. Examples of such systems would be radars (applying power
    to the magnetron) or tesla coils (impulse exciting the tuned
    circuit primary). The rotary spark gap is a mechanical means of
    repetitively shortening and lengthening a spark gap for switching
    purposes.</p>
<h4>Why use a rotary gap?</h4>
<p>Sparks are a fairly low loss conductor, particular when short
    and when carrying high current. Rotary spark gaps are typically
    constructed so that the gap distance at closest approach is
    overvoltaged by a factor of 3 to 10. Spark gaps also have the
    advantage that their &quot;turn on&quot; time is very short,
    substantially less than a microsecond. Rotary spark gaps are
    relatively inexpensive and require very little support system
    electronics, unlike hydrogen thyratrons (which require heater and
    reservoir power, as well as triggering electronics). Rotary spark
    gaps do have some jitter in their timing, not only from
    mechanical sources, but also due to the probabilistic nature of
    the spark initiation.</p>
<p>The rotary spark gap is best suited to a capacitor discharge
    or resonant charging type system, because spark gaps are really a
    &quot;make&quot; switch, and not very good at
    &quot;breaking&quot; a connection with significant current,
    because of the arc being drawn. If the load is such that the
    current oscillates, and the speed of the switch is chosen so that
    the current goes through a minimum as the gap separates.</p>
<p>Rotary spark gaps are usually operated in air, although sealed
    rotary gaps have been built for aircraft radar applications,
    where the change in air pressure would result in large
    fluctuations in the breakdown voltage of the gaps.</p>
<h4>Mechanical configurations</h4>
<p>There are a number of mechanical configurations possible for a
    rotary spark gap. The schematic diagram symbol often used for a
    rotary gap implies one of the configurations, shown in the
    following figure. As it happens, this is a poor design for most
    applications, because as the electrodes inevitably erode, the gap
    configuration changes, changing the timing characteristics of the
    gap. Axial endplay in the motor or support bearings also changes
    the gaps. A gap of this type has been used at very high powers,
    at 10 megawatts and 1000 Amps, for example, where the gap was set
    somewhat greater than 0.05 inches. In that application, the
    electrodes were estimated to need replacement every 1000 hours.</p>

<p>A better approach, in general, is to have the electrodes move
    past each other, being parallel and overlapping some distance.
    There are several approaches to doing this. One, illustrated
    below, is to have a conductive rim for the rotor and connect to
    it from a &quot;sparking sector&quot; which is an electrode
    spaced a small distance from the rim. Brushes could also be used,
    but erode very rapidly in this sort of application. The sparking
    sector works well, and with a sufficiently large size spaced very
    close, the losses are negligible. A rotary gap of this type was
    used extensively for pulse powers of 500 to 3000 kW. The gap
    between the sparking sector and the rotor rim was set in the
    range 0.010 to 0.050 inches. The capacitance between the sparking
    sector and the rim is fairly large, compared to that between the
    pin electrodes, so most of the voltage appears across the pin
    gap.</p>

                     width="265" height="205"></p>
<p>Another approach is to have pairs of fixed electrodes, either
    arranged so that the moving electrodes pass by the fixed ones, as
    in the above scheme, or so the electrode ends approach. This
    latter approach has the same disadvantages as the scheme where
    the moving electrodes are radial. An advantage of the parallel
    pin gap is that the motor/bearing axial play doesn't affect the
    gap distance.</p>

<p>This latter approach is also convenient for systems where
    multiple circuits must be switched simultaneously, as in a Marx
    generator configuration. In such an application, the mechanical
    tolerances are substantially tighter, as the pins must be aligned
    with more than one set of fixed electrodes.</p>
<p>Rotary gaps have also been built using a perforated insulating
    disk which spins between two fixed electrodes. It is easy to
    control the interelectrode gap in this sort of system, but
    erosion of the insulating disk is a real problem. Also, for lower
    voltages, the disk must be quite thin so that the gap being
    interrupted is short enough to reliably break down.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Electrode wear</h4>
<p>There is some experimental data for rotary spark gaps as used
    in radar sets from Bell Labs and the MIT Radiation Laboratory.
    The cathode wear for a gap operating in air at pulse currents of
    40 to 170 Amps has been measured at 2-6 mg/amp hour, with the
    median value being 3-4 mg/amp hour. In a Nitrogen atmosphere,
    with no oxygen, the wear rate was 10-20 times greater. The anode
    wear was 1/5 that of the cathode.</p>
<h3>Analysis of timing and jitter</h3>
<p>Figure xxx shows the two electrodes as they approach and
    recede. This figure and the following equation assume that the
    moving electrode is moving along a straight line. The distance
    between the electrodes is:</p>
<p>Distance = SQRT( DistancefromClosestApproach^2 +
    (DiamElectrode+MinSpacing)^2) - DiamElectrode</p>
<p>s = omega * r * (t0-t)</p>
<p>(assuming Sin(Theta) = Theta )</p>
<p>The E field strength between the electrodes is then:</p>
<p>E = V / Distance</p>
<p>The time jitter of the gap can be held to less than 10
    microseconds with proper gap design.</p>
<h4>The impact of thoriated electrodes</h4>
<p>If some degree of ionization in a spark gap before breakdown
    can be assured, then you don't have to depend on electrons
    emitted from the electrode surface to start the breakdown. The
    tungsten rod electrodes used in industrial arc welding are
    typically alloyed with a small amount of Thorium which is
    radioactive. The TBD particles emitted by Thorium will make the
    ionization of the gap before discharge more consistent. This will
    tend to reduce the jitter.</p>
<h4>Mechanical stresses in the rotor</h4>
<p>The mechanical design of a rotary spark gap should address the
    sizable stored energy and damage potential in a system with a
    rotor of significant mass spinning at relatively high speeds.
    Particular attention should be paid to the method by which the
    electrodes are attached to the rotor. The &quot;centrifugal&quot;
    force on these pins is:</p>
<p>Force = mass * omega^2 * radius</p>
<p>For a 10 cm radius (8 inch diameter) disk, spinning at 3600
    rpm (omega = 377 radians/sec), the acceleration is 1450 G. A
    tungsten pin 2.5 mm (0.1 inches) in diameter and 5 cm (1 inches)
    long weighs about 5 grams. The force on the pin is about 70
    Newtons (15.6 lbs). If the disk is made of 1.6 mm (.0625 inch)
    thick G-10 glass/epoxy, the load on the board is about 2500 psi,
    well within the allowable design stress for G-10 (around
    15,000-20,000 psi). However, if the pins were to be made 1 inch
    in diameter, they would now weigh about 500 grams, and exert a
    force of 1600 pounds. The bearing surface is increased to .0625
    square inches, making the load some 25,000 psi. </p>
<p>The gap should be surrounded by a &quot;scatter shield&quot;
    of some material that can contain the parts of the rotor should
    it come apart during operation. Polycarbonate (Lexan) makes a
    suitable shield, as would aluminum, steel, or fiberglass. Opaque
    materials also have the advantage of supressing the significant
    UV light emitted by the sparks, although, in some applications,
    the visual appearance of the gap may be desired (e.g. display
    Tesla coils).</p>
