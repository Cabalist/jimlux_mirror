<h2>Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6)</h2>
<p>SF6 is one of the most popular insulating gases (next to air). It has a number
    of nice properties: it's not flammable, it's non-toxic, it's (moderately) inexpensive,
    it's a good insulator (being an electronegative gas), with a breakdown strength
    of about 3 times that of air. At normal temperatures, it is non-corrosive, and
    is fairly inert, although at temperatures above 500C, it decomposes, and the
    decomposition products (Fluorine(!)) react with just about anything, especially
    any water vapor. </p>

<p>It is available from most gas dealers, particularly those specializing in electronic
    gases. The insulating grade is usually referred to as CP (chemically pure),
    although there are grades with much higher purities used in the semiconductor
    manufacturing business.</p>
<p>The current price (as of February 2000) is around $10/pound for the CP grade,
    with better grades going for up to $20/pound. It is typically sold by weight
    in medium pressure tanks at 320 psi, as a liquid.</p>
