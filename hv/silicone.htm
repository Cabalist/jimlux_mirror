<h2>Silicones</h2>
<p>Silicones are used for adhering, potting and sealing. They come in two basic forms, 1 part, which
    cure on exposure to air, moisture, or UV light, and 2 part, which cure when mixed.</p>
<p>In general, silicones have good electrical and high temperature properties, and are also quite solvent
    resistant, which raises quite a problem if you have to remove something that has been siliconed.</p>
