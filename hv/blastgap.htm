<h2>Blast Spark Gaps</h2>
<h3>Marx gap</h3>
<p>The nominal blast gap design, as described by Fr&uuml;ngel, after Marx, has 
  radially inflowing gas through the gap, with the exhaust along the central axis 
  of the electrodes. A cross section of this type of gap is shown below.</p>

<p align="left">There are some practical limits for the voltage on this type gap. 
  The ion path between the electrodes has to be able to be made before it is blown 
  out, and a suggested limit is a 2 cm spacing and 60 kV voltage. Fr&uuml;ngel 
  cites examples where these gaps are used in induction heating systems at 10-50 
  kHz repetition rates, at voltages in the 10-15 kV range, with energies of 1-2 
  Joules per discharge. In this sort of application, a capacitor and the workpiece 
  inductor form a resonant circuit with a resonant frequency of several hundred 
  kHz. </p>
<h3 align="left">RQ gap</h3>
<p align="left">The RQ (or Richard Quick) gap is a form of blast gap popular among 
  tesla coil experimenters. It is a multi segment gap made of sections of copper 
  tubing with moderate air flow axially through the assembly. The term blast is 
  probably misleading in this case, because the air supply is a small ventilating 
  fan (i.e. a &quot;muffin fan&quot;) providing m/sec (50-100 cfm) air flows.</p>
