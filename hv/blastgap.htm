<h2>Blast Spark Gaps</h2>
<h3>Marx gap</h3>
<p>The nominal blast gap design, as described by Fr&uuml;ngel, after Marx, has
    radially inflowing gas through the gap, with the exhaust along the central axis
    of the electrodes. A cross section of this type of gap is shown below.</p>

<p align="left">There are some practical limits for the voltage on this type gap.
    The ion path between the electrodes has to be able to be made before it is blown
    out, and a suggested limit is a 2 cm spacing and 60 kV voltage. Fr&uuml;ngel
    cites examples where these gaps are used in induction heating systems at 10-50
    kHz repetition rates, at voltages in the 10-15 kV range, with energies of 1-2
    Joules per discharge. In this sort of application, a capacitor and the workpiece
    inductor form a resonant circuit with a resonant frequency of several hundred
    kHz. </p>
<h3 align="left">RQ gap</h3>
<p align="left">The RQ (or Richard Quick) gap is a form of blast gap popular among
    tesla coil experimenters. It is a multi segment gap made of sections of copper
    tubing with moderate air flow axially through the assembly. The term blast is
    probably misleading in this case, because the air supply is a small ventilating
    fan (i.e. a &quot;muffin fan&quot;) providing m/sec (50-100 cfm) air flows.</p>
