<h2>Marx Generators</h2>

<p>A Marx Generator is a clever way of charging a number of
    capacitors in parallel, then discharging them in series.
    Originally described by E. Marx in 1924, Marx generators are
    probably the most common way of generating high voltage impulses
    for testing when the voltage level required is higher than
    available charging supply voltages. Furthermore, above about 200
    kV, the discharge capacitor becomes very expensive and bulky. The
    <a href="fitch.htm">Fitch</a> circuit is becoming popular where
    very good control over impulse voltage is required.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>The charging voltage is applied to the system. The stage
    capacitors charge through the charging resistors (Rc). When fully
    charged, either the lowest gap is allowed to breakdown from
    overvoltage or it is triggered by an external source (if the gap
    spacing is set greater than the charging voltage breakdown
    spacing). This effectively puts the bottom two capacitors in
    series, overvoltaging the next gap up, which then puts the bottom
    three capacitors in series, which overvoltages the next gap, and
    so forth. This process is referred to as &quot;erecting&quot;. A
    common specification is the erected capacitance of the bank,
    equal to the stage capacitance divided by the number of stages.</p>

<p>The charging resistors are chosen to provide a typical
    charging time constant of several seconds. A typical charging
    current would be in the 50-100 mA range. The charging resistors
    also provide a current path to keep the arc in the spark gaps
    alive, and so, should be chosen to provide a current of 5-10 amps
    through the gap. The resistors are sometimes called &quot;feed
    forward&quot; resistors for this reason. The discharge through
    the charging resistors sets an upper bound on the impulse fall
    time, although usually, the impulse fall time is set by external
    resistors in parallel with the load (or integrated into the
    generator, as described below).</p>

<p>For example, with a stage voltage of 100 kV, a desired output
    voltage of 1 MV (i.e. 10 stages), the charging resistors should
    be about 20-40 kOhms (corresponding to an arc current of 5 to 10
    Amps). If the capacitors were 1 uF, then the discharge time
    constant would be 20 milliseconds, much, much longer than the 50
    microsecond time constant of the standard test impulse. This
    example generator would have a stored energy of 5 kJ/stage or 50
    kJ for the total system. At a charging current of 50 mA, it would
    take at least 20 seconds to charge the entire stack.</p>

<p>If a constant voltage charging source is used, significant
    energy is dissipated in the charging resistors, equal to the
    stored energy in the capacitors.</p>

<h3>Design enhancements and considerations</h3>

<h4>Charging with a constant current source</h4>

<p>If the Marx generator is charged from a constant voltage
    source, the energy dissipated in the charging resistors will be
    equal to that stored in the Marx capacitors. If the bank is
    charged with a constant current source, this energy loss can be
    substantially reduced.</p>

<h4>Integrating the waveshaping resistors into the generator</h4>

<p>In the classic capacitor discharge impulse generator, the
    shape of the pulse is controlled by external impedances (usually
    resistors) at the &quot;output&quot; of the pulse generator. As
    voltages get higher, it gets harder to build practical resistors
    with low parasitic inductance that will also withstand the full
    impulse voltage. The usual remedy for this is to include the
    wave-shaping resistors in the Marx bank itself, as illustrated in
    the following figure.</p>

<h4>Reducing the jitter</h4>

<p>If the gaps in the Marx generator don't all fire at exactly
    the same time, the leading edge of the impulse will have steps
    and glitches as the gaps fire. These delays also result in an
    overall longer rise time for the impulse. If the jitter in the
    gaps is reduced, the overall performance is improved.</p>

<p>The traditional Marx generator operating in air has all the
    gaps in a line with the electrodes operating horizontally
    opposed. This allows the UV from bottom gap to irradiate the
    upper gaps, reducing their jitter. Tests reported in Craggs and
    Meek showed that obstructing the UV led to greatly increased
    jitter in the bank output, which they attribute to the lack of UV
    irradiation on the upper gaps.</p>

<p>For a Marx generator which is immersed in oil, or using
    enclosed spark gaps, resistor or capacitor networks can be used
    to propagate the trigger pulse to all the gaps, rather than
    relying on the overvoltaging of the upper gaps to fire them.. A
    design from Maxwell labs uses a series of resistors to apply the
    trigger impulse to all the gaps.</p>

<p>Laser irradiation or triggering of the gaps could also be
    used.</p>

<p>Craggs and Meek also report the use of radioactive sources
    included within the gap electrodes to reduce the jitter.</p>

<h4>Other switching devices</h4>

<p>The Marx technique has been used to generate impulses of
    several kilovolts from a relatively low charging source using
    avalanche transistors as the switching device instead of a spark
    gap. In this case, the resistors need to be chosen to keep the
    transistor turned on.</p>

<h4>Alternate charging schemes</h4>

<p>Particularly for lower output voltages, the capacitors can be
    charged in parallel from a common source through a series
    resistor or inductor. The charging impedance has to withstand the
    full output voltage for the top stage. For the solid state Marx
    generator running at a few kV described above, this isn't as much
    of a problem as it would be for a megavolt range lightning
    impulse simulator.</p>

<h4>Inductors as the charging impedances</h4>

<p>The charging resistors can be replaced by inductors,
    eliminating the power loss in the resistors.</p>

<h4>Increasing the repetition rate by using Hydrogen spark gaps</h4>

<p>Hydrogen has a very fast recovery time, facilitating the
    production of high rep rate pulses from a Marx circuit. An
    example of this is a design by Grothaus, Moran and Hardesty,
    shown in U.S. patent <a href="http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?patent_number=5311067">#5311067</a>. This
    is a very compact pulser running in a pressure tank filled with
    hydrogen.</p>
