<h2>Bruce profiles</h2>
<p>Bruce developed a series of electrode shapes that approximated an ideal uniform
    field. The Bruce profile is a figure of revolution, starting with a flat plane
    in the center, with a sine curve used as a transition to a circular section
    at the edge. The idea is to have a large area of uniform field (2 flat plates)
    with a gradually increasing radius of curvature to the edge. The Bruce profile
    apparently wasn't originally developed with the intention of finding an analytically
    nice E field, but was an empirically derived method to reduce the edge effects.</p>

<p>Bruce (referenced in Craggs and Meek, and in Kuffel, et.al.) claimed that electrodes
    with diameters of 4.5, 9.0, and 15 inches can be used for maximum voltages of
    140, 280, and 420 kV, respectively. The reference I have doesn't say if the
    diameter is of the flat part (AB in the above drawing) or of the outer curved
    rim. </p>
<p>A comment made by Naidu, et.al, in connection with their discussion of uniform
    field gaps is that there is no significant difference in breakdown voltage between
    sphere gaps and the various uniform field gaps, given the fairly large uncertainty
    in all the measurements. In practice, breakdown measurements are made with spherical
    electrodes, because small changes in the surface of a uniform field electrode
    can cause field irregularities which in turn dramatically affects the breakdown
    voltages. Also, a deviation from parallelism of the opposing electrode faces
    can cause significant deviations from a large uniform field area. Spheres are
    easier to make and keep smooth, even though there isn't a &quot;nice&quot; analytical
    solution to the field between the electrodes. Furthermore, if there is a misalignment
    between the spheres, the region between the spheres is still geometrically the
    same.</p>
