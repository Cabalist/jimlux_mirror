<h2>Dimmers</h2>
<p>The simple Triac light dimmer (or ceiling fan speed controller) has a lot of
    uses. However the simplicity of design, while perfectly suited to nice, well
    behaved resistive loads, doesn't work so well for loads that are reactive, or
    vary a lot during a half cycle (like a transformer driving a spark gap or discharge
    tube). </p>

<table style="width:75%;border:0">
    <tr>
        <td>Here is the &quot;canonical&quot; TRIAC dimmer schematic. The R and C
            form a phase shift (delay) network which delays the line voltage. When the
            voltage across the diac gets big enough, it conducts, triggering the triac
            ON. In older designs, a neon bulb was used instead of the diac. There are
            also devices called Quadracs which combine the diac and triac in one package.

    <tr>
        <td>Here is the usual &quot;two terminal&quot; dimmer schematic. Note that
            the voltage across the phase shift network is the voltage across the triac.
            For resistive loads, this makes almost no difference, but, for inductive
            or capacitive loads, this might not be true, since the load current and
            voltage may not be in phase.

    <tr>
        <td>This is a conceptual view of how the triac dimmer looks, using the back
            to back SCR model of a triac. This isn't perfectly accurate, but will serve
            to illustrate the problem. Note that on a positive going half cycle, when
            the voltage across the diac gets high enough, it conducts, and D2 will turn
            on. But, for a negative going half cycle, the path to turn on D1 is through
            the load. If the load isn't a nice resistive one, this might cause triggering
            problems.

<p>Reactive loads can sometimes be tamed by the expedient of putting a resistive
    load in parallel. A small light bulb or a resistor works well. More sophisticated
    phase control circuits use isolated trigger circuits (using transformers or
    optoisolators) to generate very consistent trigger pulses. For some loads, preceding
    the dimmer with a bridge rectifier might help improve the consistency, because
    the polarity of the pulses will always be the same. Another approach is to put
    the bridge around the dimmer, as illustrated in the figure below. </p>
