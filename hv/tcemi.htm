<h2>Tesla Coils and EMI</h2>
<p>This page has some basic thoughts (not rigorously analyzed) on EMI produced
    by a Tesla Coil</p>
<p>I assumed a TC that has a 50 pF top load, resonating at 100 kHz (Lsec = 50
    mH), with a peak voltage on the top load of 500 kV. This works out to 6.5 Joules.
    The peak current in the secondary is about 16 Amps. </p>
<p>I further assumed that the TC discharges by means of a spark 2 meters long
    to a ground 2 meters away, and that the entire 6.5 J is dissipated in the spark
    in one shot. I assumed a nominal inductance for the spark and ground path of
    4 microhenries (1 uH/meter is a reasonable number for a single wire...). </p>
<p><img src="images/tcemi1.gif" width="587" height="360"></p>
<p>Ignoring loss in the spark, you can consider it as a LC circuit, which, given
    the 50 pF and 4 uH, resonates at around 11 MHz, that is, the spark rise time
    will be around 20-25 nsec (1 quarter cycle). Calculating the current in the
    discharge by L*I^2 = C*V^2, you get a peak current of about 1770 Amp </p>
<p>Now, look at the radiated electric field, at a distance of, say, 10 meters.
    A basic equation for the field due to a current in a conductor is E = 120 *
    pi * I * length / ( dist * wavelength), which gives the field strength (V/meter)
    with the current of I amps, length of the radiator is length meters, and the
    distance away is in meters.</p>
<p>First, let's calculate for the field due to the current in the secondary (16A).
    The wavelength at 100 kHz is 3000 meters, and running all the numbers gives
    you a field strength of 0.4 V/m at a distance of 10 m(tesla coils make terrible
    antennas...) </p>
<p>What's more interesting, though, is the field strength due to the spark discharge.
    Two factors are important: 1) The current is a LOT higher (100 times as much,
    in fact); and 2) the frequency is higher, which makes the wavelength shorter
    (11 MHz = 26 meters). Now, running the numbers gives you a electric field strength
    of 5130 V/meter, more than 10,000 times that of the field due to the current
    in the secondary. </p>
<p>This is more than 80 dB difference! Clearly, your coil is going to interfere
    worse when it is breaking out and making big sparks. </p>
<p>Now, let's calculate the voltage induced in some "victim loop". The general
    equation for the voltage across the terminals of a loop (or, actually, all the
    way around the loop) is: V = 2 * pi * Area * Nturns * E * cos(theta)/ wavelength
    where Area is the area of the loop in square meters, Nturns is the number of
    turns in the loop, E is the field strength in V/meter, theta is the orientation
    of the loop relative to the E field orientation (assume cos(theta)=1 for worst
    case), and wavelength is in meters, too.. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the area of the victim loop is usually quite small (for instance,
    what's the area between the two wires in a piece of power cord... not much).
    But, let's say you have inadvertently hooked up your computer so that you have
    a nice loop. Perhaps you have an external modem, so the loop goes something
    like,from the outlet ground pin, up the power cord to the PC, from the PC to
    the modem along the RS232 cable, from the modem to the wall wart, and finally,
    maybe, back to the outlet. (I'm ignoring other potential loops here, like the
    phone cord itself, etc.) . It would be easy to get, say a square meter (just
    to make the numbers easy). </p>
<p>What's the voltage: 2 * 3.1415 * 1 * 1 turn * 5000 V/meter * 1/ 26 meters a
    mere 1200 V.... </p>
<p>Now.. that voltage will be distributed all the way around the loop, and will
    distribute in proportion to the series impedances at 11 MHz. Obviously, the
    voltage drop along the wires will be pretty low (although.. you have to watch
    out for the inductance... 1 uH at 11 MHz is about 70 ohms). Most of the voltage
    will be developed across the various isolation components in the system (power
    supply transformers, etc.) which look like capacitors. Hopefully, the power
    supply transformer has a very small capacitance (so the impedance is high, and
    the voltage is high across it, because it is designed for 2500V breakdown, typically).
    10 pF at 11 Mhz is 1.44 kOhm. Let's assume that 10 pF for each power supply
    (one in the PC and one in the wall wart). Let's further assume we have 4 meters
    of power and data cables.. There's probably also a couple hundred ohms between
    the RS232 line and ground in the driver circuits, etc. So, our total loop has
    a resistance of 2*1440 + 4 * 70 + 200 or, 3360 ohms total. Of the total 1200V,
    about 70 volts will appear across that 200 ohms in the RS232 driver... Result?
    Fried circuit... </p>
<p>note also that putting some sort of surge suppressor in the circuit might not
    help.. why? because the ground from the suppressor might itself form a loop.
</p>
<p>The net result is that it is remarkably easy to cook stuff with long sparks
    (as those of you fooling with Marx banks have found, particularly small ones,
    which have very fast rise times..) </p>
<p>Basic techniques:</p>
<ol>
    <li> mimimize the area of loops... bundle the power cords together</li>
    <li> distance helps</li>
    <li> carefully consider where the surge suppressors (if any) should be (close
        to the victim equipment, and directly between the sensitive leads)
    </li>
</ol>
<p> Note also that if you do a true "single point ground" system (bearing in mind
    that power distribution works as a ground wire, capacitively coupled), you can't
    get loops.... </p>
