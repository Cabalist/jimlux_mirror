<h2>Sphere Gaps</h2>

<p>A spark gap will have a very repeatable breakdown voltages for
    a given atmospheric conditions. For mostly mechanical reasons,
    uniform field gaps (using, for example <a href="rogowski.htm">Rogowski</a>
    or <a href="bruce.htm">Bruce</a> profile electrodes) are not used
    as much as sphere gaps where the spheres are quite a bit larger
    than the gap. There isn't a convenient analytical expression for
    the breakdown voltage as a function of sphere diameter and gap,
    as there is for a uniform field gap, however, there is a lot of
    empirical test data, and sphere gaps are by far and away the most
    common way of measuring high voltages with a spark gap.</p>

<p>Typical accuracies are 3% for gaps less than half the diameter
    of the sphere and 5% for the gap larger than the diameter of the
    sphere. As the gap gets larger, the field between the spheres
    gets more and more nonuniform, and as a result the scatter in the
    data gets larger. A <a href="rodgap.htm">rod gap</a> represents
    sort of the ultimate in non-uniform gap, and is often quoted at
    +/- 8% accuracy.</p>

<h3>Mechanical, electrical, and procedural details</h3>

<p>A series resistor is usually put between the source and the
    gap to limit the breakdown current and to provide some damping of
    the high frequency oscillations. It is typically 100K to 1 Meg
    for AC or DC voltages, and no more than 500 Ohms for impulse
    voltages.</p>

<p>For AC peak and DC measurements, the voltage is gradually
    increased until breakdown occurs. The mean of 5 measurements that
    fall within ± 3% is used as the value. For impulses, a 50%
    flashover voltage is calculated from the mean of two
    measurements, described as follows, which must be within 2% of
    each other. The first measurement voltage is set so that out of
    10(?) impulses, either 2 or 4 flashovers occur. The second
    measurement is set so that out of the 10 impulses, either 6 or 8
    flashovers occur. <em>(N.B.Presumably, there is some ANSI
        specification for this process, which will be used to update this
        section.)</em></p>

<p>Sphere gaps can be arranged either vertically, typically with
    the lower sphere grounded (earthed), or horizontally. The
    surroundings do have an effect on the breakdown voltage, as they
    alter the field configuration. Standard clearances are specified
    for spheres of various sizes in both configurations. These
    clearances reduce the effect of the surroundings to less than the
    specified accuracy (e.g. 3%). In the following: <strong>D</strong>
    is the diameter of the spheres, <strong>S</strong> is the spacing
    of the gap, S/D &lt;= 0.5. <strong>A</strong> is the height of
    the lowest point of the HV sphere above the ground. <strong>B</strong>
    is the radius of clearance from surrounding structions.</p>

<h3>Additional Construction details</h3>

<p>The insulator supporting the upper sphere should be less than
    0.5 D in diameter. The sphere itself should be supported by a
    conductive metal shank no more than 0.2 D in diameter and at
    least D in length (that is, the sparking point should be at least
    2D from the lower end of the upper insulator).</p>

<p>The high voltage lead should not pass near the upper
    electrode. Ideally it should be led away from shank avoiding
    crossing a plane perpendicular to the shank at least 1 D away
    from the sphere (i.e. 2 D away from the sparking point, until it
    is outside of a sphere of radius B from the sparking point.</p>

<p>The top of the lower electrode should be at least 1.5D above
    the (presumably) grounded floor.</p>

<p>Horizontal gaps are much the same as vertical gaps, except
    that both electrodes are insulated. The insulators should be
    longer, at least 2D long (putting the sparking point at least 4D
    from the supports: 2D for the insulator, 1D for the shank, 1D for
    the sphere). And, both spheres should be the appropriate
    clearance from the floor or external objects.</p>
