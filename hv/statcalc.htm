<h3>Some practical electrostatic calculations</h3>
<p>It is often instructive to see a practical application of theoretical principles, so here are some
    examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#vdgmaxv">Maximum voltage on the Science First(tm) 400kV Van de Graaff
        generator</a></li>
    <li><a href="#vdgcap">Capacitance and stored energy of the 400 kV Van deGraaff</a></li>
    <li><a href="#vdgforce">Force from the 400 kV Van de Graaf on a grounded sphere</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160; </p>

<h4><a name="vdgmaxv">Maximum</a> voltage on the Science First(tm) 400kV Van deGraaff
    generator</h4>
<p>One limit on the maximum voltage that a Van deGraaff generator can reach is
    when the electric field strength at the surface of the sphere exceeds the breakdown
    for the insulating gas it is immersed in. The section on Van deGraaff generators
    describes other limitations such as arcing down the belt. For small demonstration
    type generators&#160;operating in room air, however, the E field limit is usually
    applicable.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">Field at surface of a sphere = Voltage / Radius of Sphere</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we use the handy approximation of 30 kV/cm for the breakdown strength of air and rearrange
    the equation a bit to get:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">MaxVoltage = 30 kV * Radius(cm)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The classic Franklin Lee designed Van deGraaff from Scientific American has
    an upper electrode about 14 inches in diameter which actually has a minimum
    radius of curvature of about 7 inches (it is a &quot;squashed&quot; sphere).</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">MaxVoltage = 30 kV/cm * 17.5 cm = 525 kV</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The generator is advertised as reaching 400 kV, which is probably a realistic assessment, given that
    it isn't perfectly smooth and that there is an insulating column between the sphereoid and the ground
    plane at the base.</p>
<hr>
<h4><a name="vdgcap">Capacitance</a> and stored energy of 400 kV Van deGraaff</h4>
<p>While the upper electrode on that Van deGraaff isn't perfectly spherical, we
    can probably approximate it as one to calculate the capacitance and stored energy.
    Note that here, we'll use the real radius of the sphereoid, as opposed to the
    breakdown voltage calculation, where we used the smallest radius of curvature.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">r = 7 inches = .178 meters</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">Csphere = 4*pi*epsilon*r = 111.2 pF/meter * .178 meters = 19.8
        pF</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, let's calculate the stored energy: Is it a crack or a bang when we discharge it?</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">Energy = 0.5 * C * V^2</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">Energy = 0.5 * 19.8E-12 * 4E5^2 = 1.5 Joules</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A handy form of the energy equation is: <span style="font-family: monospace">Energy (Joules)= 1/2 * C(microfarads) *
    V(kilovolts) ^2</span>. The units nicely cancel.)</p>
<hr>
<h4><a name="vdgforce">Force</a> from 400 kV Van deGraaff on a grounded sphere</h4>
<p>Pretty much the first thing people do when they get a demonstration Van deGraaff
    is to make sparks from the upper electrode. When I did this, I was amazed at
    the electrostatic force on the grounded electrode I was discharging to. It is
    one thing to intellectually know about Columb forces, and another to feel them
    in your arm muscles (or to watch them move the electrodes around). As it happens,
    calculating the field between two conducting spheres is a non trivial task because
    the charge isn't evenly distributed. However, let's approximate (since experiment
    will determine the exact number, we only need to know if it is a tiny force
    or a huge one).</p>
<p>At 400 kV, the gap between the spheres will be a minimum of 10-15 cm. Let's use 15 cm spacing
    of 15 cm radius spheres for the calculation. A first order approximation will use Coulomb's law,
    and treat the sphere as a point charge at the center. First question: How much charge?</p>
<p>q = CV = 19.8E-12 * 400E3 = 7.920E-6 Coulombs</p>
<p>I've approximated C as a sphere in free space, which certainly isn't the case, but will do for an
    order of magnitude calculation</p>
<p>Now, let's use Coulomb's law</p>
<p>F = 1/(4*pi*epsilon) *q1 * q2 / r^2 = 1/111.2E-12 * 7.92E-6 * 7.92E-6 / (.45^2)</p>
<p>= 2.78 Newtons (approximately)</p>
<p>About a half a pound, which is more than you would expect at first glance.</p>
