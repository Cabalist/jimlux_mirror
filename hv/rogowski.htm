<h2>Rogowski profiles</h2>
<p>There are applications which require a uniform electrical
    field between two electrodes such as breakdown voltage testing
    and large volume laser discharge cavities. The ideal infinite
    flat plates are somewhat difficult to realize in a lab of
    reasonable dimensions. Finite sized plates produce a uniform
    field at the middle of the plate, but the high field at the edges
    creates a problem.</p>
<p>Rogowski (also variously spelled Rogovski, which is closer to
    the Russian pronounciation) developed a technique that starts by
    determining a realizable field, then constructing an electrode
    shaped so that the surface of the electrode lies on an
    equipotential surface. He started with an analytical solution of
    the field due to a finite plane plate parallel to an infinite
    plane. A more empirical approach was taken by Bruce, described <a
            href="bruce.htm">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p>Taken to an extreme, the field at a large (d&gt;&gt;x)
    distance from any charge distribution approximates the field from
    a point charge, i.e. a sphere. The arbitrary charge could be
    replaced by a sphere of appropriate size and voltage/charge, and
    the E field would be the same.</p>
<p>For example, consider the field between two finite flat
    plates. In the center region, the field is quite uniform.
    However, if one actually constructed such electrodes, you would
    find that the high field strength at the edges of the plates
    would almost certainly cause problems from dielectric breakdown.
    The solution is to construct electrodes that follow an
    equipotential surface which is some distance from the flat plate
    electrode. Since it is farther away, the field strength is lower,
    and breakdown is not as much of an issue.</p>
<p>For an arbitrary shaped electrode, determining the electric
    field, particularly in the dynamic case, is quite difficult, and
    would normally need to be done by numerical techniques. However,
    for some special cases that happen to be useful, an analytical
    expression for the field can be developed. Such a case would be
    the finite flat plates above, for which the expression was
    developed by Maxwell (J.C Maxwell, <em>Electricity and Magnetism</em>,
    3rd Ed, Vol I), and further extended by Rogowski (W. Rogowski, <em>Arch.
        f. Elekt.</em> v.12, p. 1, 1923, also v. 12, p.73, 1926, and v.
    16, p76, 1926).</p>

<p>Rogowski showed that the gradient (i.e. the E field strength)
    between the electrodes is greater than the gradient outside the
    plane portion for any value of psi &lt;= PI/2. In this situation,
    the above equation reduces to:<br>
    <img src="images/rogows2.gif" width="101" height="88"></p>
<p>If psi &lt;= 0.4pi, the field is greatest in the center region
    between the plates, and less everywhere else. If you make the
    electrode follow this contour, the breakdown voltage between the
    electrodes will be the same as if they were an infinite uniform
    field.</p>
<p>Rengier (who worked with Rogowski) created electrodes by
    revolving surfaces for psi = PI/2 and 2/3 PI. He found that the
    sparks always occurred within the central planar part, and not
    the edges. Electrodes constructed with 5/6 PI always sparked at
    the edges. The 2/3 PI profile, while not as ideal as the PI/2 (or
    less) profile, will work adequately. The back surface of the
    electrode must also be smoothly curved.</p>
<p><a href="hvrefs.htm#cobine">Cobine</a>, p. 177 has quite a bit
    of detail on this, as well as other references. Craggs &amp; Meek
    also make some references to Rogowski's work.</p>
<p>An MS Excel spreadsheet to calculate electrode profiles can be
    downloaded from <a

    (58K). If you want to download it without running Excel
    automatically, right click on the link, and use the <em>Save

<p>A graph from the above spreadsheet, showing equipotentials at
    intervals of .2, .4, .6, .8 and 1.0 as well as flux lines for a
    normalized case is shown below (it's 16 K, so it takes a while to
    load) <em>(it is also 911x623 pixels, until I scale it down a bit
        so it fits better.)</em></p>
