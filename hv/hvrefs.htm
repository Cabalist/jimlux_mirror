<h2>&#160;References</h2>
<p>Obviously, I didn't figure out all this high voltage stuff from scratch. Here is an annotated list of
    references that one might find handy. Unfortunately, many of these are out of print, so you'll have to
    check the library. I have tried to provide as much information as possible to help you track these
    down. Most of these references are standard works, so most good university libraries have a copy.</p>
<p><a name="CraggsMeek">Craggs</a>, and Meek, <em>High Voltage Laboratory Technique</em>, Butterworth Scientific Publishers,
    London, 1954<br>
    The publisher is now Butterworth-Heinemann. This is out of print, and the publisher does not hold
    the copyright, so it probably rests with the authors (or more likely, their heirs). This is the standard
    work in the area, a compendium of the state of high voltage art in the early 50's. The author's
    intention was to collect the currently available information, much of which was in German at the
    time, into one reference work (much as I am trying to do). Much of what Craggs and Meek have
    to say is still valid, although modern materials and components have improved the situation
    somewhat: rectifiers are almost invariably stacks of silicon diodes these days, although if you want a
    single device with a 300 kV PIV rating, a vacuum diode is hard to beat (rather than stringing 300
    1000PIV silicon diodes in series).</p>
<p><a name="Cobine">Cobine</a>, James Dillon, <em>Gaseous Conductors: Theory and Engineering Applications</em>, Dover
    Publications, New York, 1958. paperback, xx+600 pp, 5 3/8x8<br>
    This is out of print. Here is the back cover blurb, which describes the work quite accurately:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><tt>Almost upon publication, this work became known as an
        indispensible text and reference for electrical engineers,
        radio engineers, physicists, lighting engineers, students,
        instructors, and everone concerned with gaseous conduction
        phenomen associated with missiles, atomic energy and fusion
        processes, and atmospheric research. Now, corrected and with a
        new introduction by the author, its usefulness is greatly
        increased.</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p><tt>The author begines with a thorough exposition of the
        fundamentals necessary to an understanding of the engineering
        applications of gaseous conductors. The physical concepts of
        the kinetic theory of gases, atomic structure, ionization, and
        emission phenomena are carefully considered. He then
        undertakes a detailed development of the throry of space
        charges, the breakdown of gases, spark characteristics, glow
        and arc discharges. The engineering applications of discharge
        phenomena in circuit interrupters, rectifiers, light sources,
        oscillographs, etc., are treated in great detail and with full
        awareness of the important differences of approach between
        academic and industrial studies.</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p><tt>All the fundamentals developed have direct and important
        bearings on gaseous conduction, and Dr. Cobine, has maintained
        his determination to let the engieering viewpoint prevail even
        in his discussions of theory. Of particular interest is the
        separate detailed treatment of low-pressure arcs (following
        Langmuir and Tonks) and high-pressure arcs (following Suits),
        considerable study of gas-discharge light sources, circuit
        interruption, circuit constants, rectifiers (tube and steel
        tank types), and cathode ray oscillographs, and the
        investigation of the characteristics of corona with special
        attention to space-charge effects and Holm's analysis.</tt></p>

<p><a name="Somerville">Somerville</a> J. M., <em>The Electric Arc</em>, Methuen, London, 1959 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York)<br>
    Dr Somerville neatly summarizes much of the information in the 600 pages of Cobine's work in a
    150 page monograph. There isn't as much on dielectric breakdown or on the theoretical basis for
    arc characteristics, but overall, a readable book. This book has a nice section on the development
    of the spark channel.</p>
<p><a name="Edgerton">Edgerton</a>, Harold E., <em>Electronic Flash, Strobe</em>, MIT This book is still in print, and is fairly
    inexpensive at around $20.<br>
    While the primary aim of this book is for xenon strobe lamps, there is a lot of useful information on
    initiating the discharge, as well as practical details on capacitor charging supplies, and so forth. </p>
<p><a name="Fr&uuml;ngel">Fr&uuml;ngel</a>, Frank, <em>High Speed Pulse Technology</em>, Academic Press, 1965, two volumes<br>
    There is a newer edition of this book from 1970, with four volumes, which I have not yet seen. It is
    more common (some 300+ owners, according to the interlibrary loan desk). I assume it is better
    and covers even more. Fr&uuml;ngel is &quot;Dr. Pulse&quot;, and for him, everything, from killing snails in the
    garden and crushing aluminum beer cans to nuclear fusion, is a possible application of pulse
    technology. This is a most complete compendium, in large part translated from his earlier works in
    German, with all sorts of useful information, particularly on basic design principles for things like
    capacitor banks and impulse transformers. Like Edgerton, Fr&uuml;ngel did a lot with fast strobes
    (brighter, faster, bigger, etc.). Much of the book is a bit stilted, reading like patent applications
    (which I suspect a lot of it really is edited from), however, more than enough information is there to
    allow an &quot;ordinarily skilled practioner of the art to duplicate the invention&quot;</p>
<p><a name="Lowden">Lowden</a>, Eric, <em>Practical transformer design handbook</em>, 2nd ed., Tab Books, Blue Ridge
    Summit, 1989, ISBN 0-8306-3212-3<br>
    This is a fairly useful book dealing with transformer design at a practical level without much
    theoretical detail. If you need to figure out what that surplus transfomer is, or make/modify one
    from scratch, this is the book you need. It takes the theoretical design information and puts it in a
    practical context, as well as providing a lot of &quot;rule of thumb&quot; information.</p>
<p><a name="Naidu">Naidu</a>, M.S. and Kamaraju, V., <em>High Voltage Engineering</em>, 2nd ed., McGraw Hill, 1995, ISBN
    0-07-462286-2<br>
    A textbook on HV engineering, with chapters on breakdown phenomena in gases, liquids, and
    solids, oriented towards practical application. Also has chapters on testing methods: sphere gaps,
    pulse generators, measuring techniques, etc. Quite a useful book with lots of practical data on
    commonly used materials.</p>
<p><a name="Bazelyan">Bazelyan</a>, E.M. and Raizer, Yu. P., <em>Spark Discharge</em>, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1998. about
    $100. A pretty good book on the dynamics and theory of the development of long sparks (i.e.
    bigger than 30 cm), typically at voltages &gt; 1 Megavolt. Has a good chapter on Experimental
    Techniques covering Marx and Fitch generators, measurement techniques, etc. It has a great
    picture of a 100 meter+ spark from a 5 MV impulse generator to a 130 kV transmission line.
    Now, there is &quot;high voltage&quot;!</p>
<p><a name="Wildi">Wildi</a>, Theodore, <em>Electrical Machines, Drives, and Power
    Systems</em>, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 2nd Ed, 1991 (There
    is a third edition out now) about $50, ISBN 0-13-251547-4. This a good textbook
    on AC and DC power, three phase motors and generators, basic distribution, etc.
    It has good explanation of mutual inductance, leakage inductance, and other
    transformer parameters. It is very accessible in a qualitative sense without
    too much math, but does provide some mathematical rigor if required. Lots of
    very clear (in a pedagogical sense) illustrations and photographs. It doesn't
    delve too deeply into derivations, so, this isn't the book if you want lots
    of theoretical details of the electromagnetic theory of salient pole induction
    motors.</p>
<p>North, William, High Power microwave-tube transmitters, Los Alamos National
    Laboratory. Report LA-12786-MS or DE94005340 available also as 25.9MB pdf on
    the web at <a href="http://lib-www.lanl.gov/la-pubs/00208841.pdf">http://lib-www.lanl.gov/la-pubs/00208841.pdf</a>.
    This is an excellent handbook aimed at big tube transmiters, but with a lot
    of useful information on high voltage power supplies, crowbars, etc.</p>

    has a lot of useful practical information derived in part from wartime research.</p>
