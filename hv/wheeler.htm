<h2>Wheeler Formulas for Inductance</h2>
<p>These formulas, developed by Wheeler at the (then) NBS, give approximate
    inductances for various coil configurations. They are primarily based on empirical
    measurements, and are accurate to a few percent.</p>
<h4>Single layer air core solenoid</h4>
<p><tt>L (uH) = r^2 * n^2 / (9 * r + 10 * l)</tt></p>
<p>where </p>
<p><tt>r = coil radius in inches<br>
    l = coil length in inches<br>
    n = number of turns</tt></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Multi layer air core solenoid</h4>
<p><tt>L (uH) = 0.8 * a^2 * n^2 / (6*a + 9*b + 10*c )</tt></p>
<p>where <br>
    <tt>a = average radius of windings<br>
        b = length of the coil<br>
        c = difference between the outer and inner radii of the coil.<br>
        all dimensions in inches.</tt></p>
<p>It states that it is accurate to 1% when the terms in the denominator are<br>
    about equal. This is also an equation by Wheeler. It applies as long as the<br>
    coil has a rectangular cross section.</p>
<h4>Flat &quot;pancake&quot; coil</h4>
<p><tt>L (uH) = r^2 * n^2 / (8 * r + 11 * w)</tt></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><tt>r = radius to center of windings in inches<br>
    w = width of windings (in inches)<br>
    n = number of turns</tt></p>

<h3>Numerically calculating inductance</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.coe.ufrj.br/%7Eacmq/">Dr. Antonio Carlos M. de Queiroz
</a>at the University of Brazil has written a set of programs to calculate inductance
    (particularly mutual inductance) of coils of any shape from first principles.
    The INCA program is particularly useful, and can be found at <a href="http://www.coe.ufrj.br/%7Eacmq/programs/" target="_blank">http://www.coe.ufrj.br/~acmq/programs/</a>.
    The program also computes capacitance, etc.</p>
