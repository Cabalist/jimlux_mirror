<h2>Fitch Impulse Generators</h2>

<p>The Fitch circuit is used when better control of the impulse
    voltage is required than can be provided by the <a
            href="marx.htm">Marx</a> circuit.</p>

    There's an error in this drawing.. there should not be a short from R2 to ground.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Let's just consider a couple of stages. </p>
<table style="width:75%;border:0">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <h4>Charging</h4>
            <p>During charging, the capacitors charge through D1 and L1. Current passes
                to the next stage through D2. The polarity of the voltages on C1 and C2
                are reversed, so there is no net voltage on the two.</p>
            <p>Ia is the charging current throug D1, L, and C1. Ib is the charging current
                through D1, L, C2, and R2. Ic is the charging current through D1, D2,
                D1 (in the second stage), L(second stage), and C1(second stage). And so
                forth.</p>

        <td>

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>Now we are charged and ready to fire.</p>
<table style="width:75%;border:0">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <h4>Erection, phase 1</h4>
            <p>Now, we trigger the gaps, so current starts to flow in the resonant circuit
                C2, L1, D2, SG, shown by loop ILC. D1 is reverse biased during this time:
                C1, L, D1, SG.</p>
        </td>
        <td><img src="images/fitch2.gif" width="265" height="294"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <h4>Erection, phase 2</h4>
            <p>A half period later, the voltage on C2 is entirely reversed, but it cannot
                discharge, because D2 would be reverse biased. The spark gap extinguishes.</p>
            <p>C1 and C2 are now in series with the same polarity, so the stage voltage
                is twice the original charge voltage. The fall time is set by the resistance
                of R2</p>
        </td>
        <td><img src="images/fitch3.gif" width="265" height="317"></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<h3>Design ideas</h3>
<p>L must be able to store all the energy in C2 in this circuit. One would also
    want to keep the loop current high enough that the spark gap stays &quot;ignited&quot;
    (on the order of 4-5 Amps), but low enough that the diode D2 doesn't disappear
    in a puff of smoke. Most diodes, though, have a Ipk substantially higher (10-20
    times) than their continuous rating (1N400x series of 1Amp diodes have an I<sub>FSM</sub>
    of 30A, 1N540x (3Amp) series has I<sub>FSM</sub> of 200A). </p>
<p>Say we have a stage voltage of 50 kV, and 1 uF capacitors (i.e. a stored energy
    of 1.25 kJ). We want to keep the peak current below 150A (we're using some form
    of 3Amp diodes..), and since E=0.5 L I^2, we can calculate the inductance as
    L = 2500/(150*150) or 0.11 Henry, which seems quite high...</p>
<p>Perhaps, if one used much smaller capacitors... 10 nF, for example. Then, the
    inductance would be 1.1 mH, which, although high, would start to be more practical.
    In this case, the half period ( 2*pi*sqrt(L*C2)) would be about 20 microseconds.
</p>
<p>One would probably want erection times substantially less than a microsecond,
    though, so a more reasonable inductance would be even smaller, although, that
    will raise the peak diode current.</p>
