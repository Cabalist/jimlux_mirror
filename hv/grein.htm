<h2>Greinacher Cascades</h2>
<p>One strategy for generating high voltages, without requiring
    excessive insulation on the transformers, is a cascade
    arrangement as described by Greinacher in 1920 (?). A cascade of
    transformers, each insulated at twice the stage voltage, is
    connected as shown in the following figure. The stage voltages
    are rectified and filtered with the filter capacitors connected
    in series to develop the desired output voltage.</p>

<p>The above figure shows the transfomers with iron cores,
    however, with the use of a higher frequency source (i.e. RF), air
    core transformers can be used with the attendant reduction in
    weight. In fact, any means of getting the power up the cascade
    can be used, providing the losses are acceptable and the
    insulation level is appropriate. A cascade of capacitors could
    also be used, in which case, the system starts to look like a
    classic Cockroft-Walton multiplier.</p>
<p>This scheme can also be used to generate high AC voltages, by
    omitting the rectifiers and filter capacitors, and connecting the
    stages together, essentially creating a cascade of
    autotransformers.</p>
<p>The significant design issue is that the &quot;bottom&quot;
    transformer must be sized to carry not only the power for the
    bottom stage, but also the N-1 stages above. One could design a
    system using ever decreasing transformer sizes, however, the
    economies of scale and convenience in building multiple identical
    sections means that the upper stages have over capacity.</p>
<p>A similar strategy, using a third, or tertiary winding on the
    transformers has also been used. This has the advantage that the
    power can be transmitted between stages using relatively low
    voltages, requiring fewer turns of thicker, easier to handle
    wire. The tertiary winding must be insulated from the other
    windings by the full stage voltage however. This strategy is of
    some use when inexpensive surplus transformers with an
    appropriate winding are available, an example of which is here.</p>
<p>Another form of the system is to use isolation transformers
    between the stages, insulated for the stage voltage, and a
    separate HV transformer at each stage, feeding the rectifiers and
    filters as appropriate.</p>
