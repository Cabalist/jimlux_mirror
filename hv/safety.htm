<p>The risk of death or injury is significant in many high voltage, and particularly
    high energy systems. The following general guidelines are suggested: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Turn off the power before touching part of high voltage system, or even
        getting close. A key switch or lockout device
    </li>
    <li>High voltage capacitors may hold a charge long after power is turned off.
        Always discharge capacitors and keep them shorted in storage or when
        working on them.. Even after being shorted, a capacitor can regain
        significant voltage when open circuited. Ideally, the system should be
        designed so that the capacitor shorting is failsafe.
    </li>
    <li>Make sure the metal cases of transformers, motors, control panels and
        other items should be properly grounded.
    </li>
    <li>Keep a safe distance from energized, or potentialy energized
        components. OSHA guidelines provide for the following distances. Don't
        move conductive objects too close to energized components
    </li>
    <li>Use adequate fusing of the power and/or circuit breakers to limit the
        maximum current
    </li>
    <li>Spend some time laying out your circuits. Hot glue, electrical tape and
        exposed wiring are quick and easy, but could be lethal.
    </li>
</ol>
<p align=center><b>Information about electricity and humans</b></p>
<p>Lightning kills about 300 people each year in the United States, and injures an
    additional three to four times this number. (Sorry, I have no data for the rest of
    the planet.) More than one thousand people are killed each year in the U.S.
    due to generated electric current, and several thousand more are injured. (This
    would include potential tesla coilers.) In the case of lightning, the voltage and
    current are extremely high, but the duration is short. The current tends to flow
    on the outside of the body and may cause burns, respiratory arrest and/or
    cardiac arrest. Many die from lightning due to respiratory arrest rather than
    cardiac arrest. (The portion of the brain controlling breathing is often severely
    affected in a lightning strike.) Power line deaths usually involve lower voltages
    and currents, but the duration may be significant. Often the current flows inside
    the body, causing deep burns and cardiac arrest. Frequently, the individual
    cannot let go of the power source due to involuntary muscle contraction. The
    brain and heart are the most sensitive organs. The dose response for animal and
    human data suggest the following: for less than 10 mA hand to foot of 50-60
    cycle line current, the person merely feels a &quot;funny&quot; sensation; for currents
    above 10 mA, the person freezes to the circuit and is unable to let go; For
    currents of 100 mA to one ampere, the likelihood of sudden death is greatest.
    Above one ampere, the heart is thrown into a single contraction, and internal
    heating becomes significant. The individual may be thrown free of the power
    source, but may go into respiratory and/or cardiac arrest. </p>
<p>Six factors determine the outcome of human contact with electrical current:
    voltage, amperage, resistance, frequency, duration and pathway. I will discuss
    each individually. </p>
<p>Voltage </p>
<p>Low voltages generally do not cause sudden death unless the external
    resistance is low (so don't fire up your coil in wet areas). As the voltage is
    increased, more and more current passes through the body, possibly causing
    damage to the brain, heart, or causing involuntary muscle contractions. Perhaps
    100-250 volts A. C. is the most lethal voltage, because it is high enough to
    cause significant current flow through the body, and may cause muscles to
    contract tightly, rendering the victim incapable of letting go. Lower voltages
    often are insufficient to cause enough current flow, and higher voltages may
    cause the victim to be thrown clear of the hazard due to the particularly fierce
    involuntary muscle contractions. Arcing may occur with high voltages, however.
    Naturally, burns become more severe as the voltage is increased. </p>
<p>Amperage </p>
<p>Greater amperage means greater damage, especially due to heating within
    tissues. As little as 10 microamps of current passing directly through the heart
    can cause ventricular fibrillation (heart muscle fibers beat out of sync, so no
    blood is pumped) and cardiac arrest. Because of the air filled lungs, much of
    the current passing through the chest may potentially pass through the heart.
    The spinal cord may also be affected, altering respiration control. 100-1000
    milliamperes is sufficient to induce respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest.
    Thermal heating of tissues increases with the square of the current (I2R), so
    high current levels can cause severe burns, which may be internal. </p>
<p>Resistance </p>
<p>A heavily callused dry palm may have a resistance of 1 megohm. A thin, wet
    palm may register 100 ohms of resistance. Resistance is lower in children.
    Different body tissues exhibit a range of resistances. Nerves, arteries and
    muscle are low in resistance. Bone, fat and tendon are relatively high in
    resistance. Across the chest of an average adult, the resistance is about 70-100
    ohms. Thermal burns due to I2R losses in the body can be significant, resulting
    in the loss of life or limb long after the initial incident. A limb diameter
    determines the approximate &quot;cross section&quot; which the current will flow through,
    (for moderate voltages and low frequencies). As a result, a current passing
    through the arm generates more temperature rise and causes more thermal
    damage than when passing through the abdomen. </p>
<p>Frequency </p>
<p>The &quot;skin effect&quot; also applies to a human conductor, and as the frequency gets
    above about 500 kHz or so, little energy passes through the internal organs. (I
    unfortunately have little data in the 50-250 kHz range, where we operate most
    tesla coils. I'll check another reference I have at home.) At a given voltage,
    50-60 A.C. current has a much greater ability to cause ventricular fibrillation
    than D.C. current. In addition, at 50-60 Hz, involuntary muscle contractions
    may be so severe that the individual cannot let go of the power source. Higher
    frequencies are less able to cause these involuntary contractions. </p>
<p>Duration </p>
<p>Obviously, the longer the duration, the more severe the internal heating of
    tissues. Duration is particularly a problem when working with 110-240 volts
    A.C., which can render the individual incapable of letting go. </p>
<p>Pathway </p>
<p>If the current passes through the brain or heart, the likelihood of a lethal dose
    increases significantly. For example, hand to hand current flow carries a 60%
    mortality, whereas hand to foot current flow results in 20% overall mortality. Be
    aware that foot to foot conduction can also occur, if a high voltage lead is
    inadvertently stepped on or if grounding is inadequate. </p>
<p>Electrical Precautions </p>
<p>Obviously, the A.C. line voltage, the high voltage transformer and the high
    voltage R.F. generated by a tesla coil are each potentially lethal in their own
    unique ways. One must always respect this extreme danger and use high
    voltage shielding, contactors, safety interlocks, careful R.F. and A.C.
    grounding, and safe operating procedures when working with coils. A safety
    key to prevent inexperienced operators from energizing a coil is essential. High
    voltage capacitors can also retain lethal energies (especially in the &quot;equidrive&quot;
    configuration) and should always be grounded before adjusting a primary.
    Whenever possible, have a buddy around to assist you. Place one hand in your
    pocket when near electrical components so the current won't pass through your
    chest, and use the back of your hand to touch any electrical components so you
    can let go if it happens to bite you. Remember that most deaths are caused by
    regular 110 A.C. power! Never perform coiling when overtired or under the
    influence of mind altering drugs. Watch a tesla video instead! </p>
<p align=center><b>More Tesla coils electrical danger information</b></p>
<p>The previous article mentioned some of them in a general electrical hazard
    context, while this article will attempt to discuss the dangers from a tesla coil
    point of view. </p>
<p>Electrical Dangers </p>
<p>Exposed wiring on transformers. Most transformers have exposed high voltage
    lugs. </p>
<p>Most neon sign transformers that I have seen used for tesla coil usage have
    exposed lugs. A 15000 volt transformer has a turn ratio of 125:1 (assuming
    120 volts in). If you haven't disconnected your input power from the source
    (unplugged your variac), you may be in for a surprise. A variac that is putting
    out two volts will give you a 250 volt shock if you touch the high voltage
    outputs of the neon sign transformer! </p>
<p>Pole pigs (also known as distribution transformers, such as the one that is
    probably hanging on a utility pole near your home) have the same dangers as
    mentioned above, as well as having much more current available. At the output
    voltage of a pole pig, the current that can go through you is not really limited by
    anything other than the current regulation that you attached to the pig. </p>
<p>Once I shocked myself with one end (7500 volts) of a 60 mA. neon sign
    transformer. I just brushed against an exposed end, so I wasn't gripping
    anything. It was quite painful, much more so than touching a sparkplug wire. I
    felt the path of the current follow my arm, and go down my leg. Keep one hand
    in your pocket when working near or with charged items. (Capacitors,
    secondary coils, etc.) </p>
<p>Richard Hull's &quot;Tesla Coil Primer&quot; tape has some excellent safety suggestions in
    it, is entertaining, informative, and well worth the money. One of his best
    suggestions is the one of holding the power plug to the power transformer in
    your hand whenever you are putting your hands around the circuit. </p>
<p>The transmission line between your high voltage transformer and your tesla coil
    is another potential source of electrocution. This should be constructed using
    neon sign wiring (rated to 40 kV) or thick coaxial cable like RG-8A/U or
    RG-11A/U. If using coaxial cable, use the inner conductor for the high voltage,
    and strip back the outer braid about 6-12 inches from each end. Connect one
    end of the braid to your RF ground. Leave the other end unconnected so it
    does not form a current loop. Some coilers also place their high voltage cables
    inside a plastic conduit, which is laid on the floor. This also protects the cable
    somewhat from strikes. </p>
<p>Charged capacitors </p>
<p>&quot;Equidrive&quot; systems will almost always have a residual charge remaining on the
    capacitor when the system is turned off. The &quot;equidrive&quot; system uses two
    capacitors in the primary coil circuit. The gap is across the transformer, and the
    capacitors extend from the gap to each side of the primary coil. Even with the
    gap shorted, the capacitors can hold a lethal voltage. If you use this
    configuration, make yourself a shorting rod using a piece of copper tubing or
    wire with an insulating handle attached, and always short out each capacitor at
    the end of each run, and again each time you plan to touch the primary system. </p>
<p>Capacitors can also build up a residual charge from electrostatic sources. </p>
<p>Capacitors have been known to accumulate a charge from various sources
    such as static electricity and electric fields. IF YOU STORE A CAPACITOR,
    STORE IT WITH A WIRE ACROSS THE TERMINALS. (MAKE SURE
    YOU DISCHARGE THE CAPACITOR BEFORE PUTTING THE WIRE
    ON!!!) </p>
<p>Capacitors can &quot;regain&quot; charge from dielectric &quot;memory&quot;. The dielectric in a
    capacitor is put under electrical stress during use. During operation, this stress
    may cause the molecules in the dielectric to orient themselves in such a manner
    that they store this charge in their structure. The charge remains after the
    capacitor has been discharged. Later the molecules return to their original states
    and the charge that they &quot;captured&quot; ends up on the plates of the capacitor. This
    charge is then available to shock you. </p>
<p>Other sources of danger </p>
<p>You are literally playing Russian Roulette when you stick a hand held metal rod
    into the output streamer of your coil running at 3kvA, while standing on a
    concrete floor!!! When you start running these kind of power levels (or even
    less) some coils have a tendency to form a corona or even send a streamer
    down to their own primaries every once in a while. A grounded strike ring is
    often added around the primary to try to prevent this self striking streamer from
    hitting the primary coil and thus introducing a high voltage pulse into the 'bottom
    end electronics' where it could do damage to components. These strike rails
    are not 100% effective. The streamer can still, and sometimes does strike a
    point downstairs that is part of the LETHAL high voltage 60 Hz circuitry.
    When such a contact is made, any person also connected to a corona/streamer
    link to the secondary at the same time will, via the ionized air path, become
    connected to lethal 60 Hz mains current. You could try the trick you described
    standing on the cement floor in your tennis shoes half a dozen times and live, or
    be killed the very next time you try it. The fact that the bottom of your
    secondary is tied to ground will not save you! </p>
<p>If you isolate your own body well away from the floor and any other potentially
    conductive objects in the vicinity, such as sitting or standing on an elevated
    insulated platform (I would NOT consider a plastic milk crate adequate!), then
    you will probably survive if 60 Hz is introduced into the streamer you are in
    contact with by the mechanism described above. However, in setting up this
    insulated platform you must consider the path that may be taken from streamers
    that will re-emerge from your body and head off looking for other targets,
    which could result in direct contact with earth ground again. </p>
<p>In a safety warning I have about the potential hazards of Tesla coils mention is
    made of a stage lecturer while demonstrating how he could cause long sparks
    to come out of his fingers (by standing on a specially constructed coil), was
    electrocuted when the discharge created an ionized path to grounded overhead
    pipes supporting stage back drops, and the lower voltage but far more deadly
    60 cycle current passed through his body along that path. The name of this
    lecturer is believed to be Transtrom. </p>
<p>I was dinking around once with a vacuum tube coil drawing 15 inch streamers
    to a hand-held, 10 megohm metal film porcelain resistor about a foot long while
    standing on a carpeted, elevated wooden floor in composition rubber soled dry
    shoes. I inadvertently got the resistor too close to the primary tank coil (the top
    end directly connected to the 3 kilovolt output of the plate supply transformer)
    and the high voltage RF closed a path to the primary. I felt an uncomfortable 60
    Hz shock through my entire body. Had that resistor been a solid metal rod I
    would have experienced a very painful jolt or worse, and had I been standing
    on a cement floor, I'd probably be 'worm food'. </p>
<p>I think the danger of electrocution is just as real by making contact with a hand
    held florescent lamp tube, as any solid conducting metal object. </p>
<p>I cringe when I hear of some body contact stunts proposed by people on this
    list! The potential (no pun intended) for death is very real. Be EXTREMELY
    careful! </p>
<p>Another viewpoint </p>
<p>The 60 cycle side of things is where electrocution can happen. Keep well away
    from any 60 cycle leads, use grounds and cages as appropriate. Bear in mind
    that if a radio frequency arc starts from a place which also has 60 cycles on it
    (one side of a primary circuit, for example) there is the possibility of
    high-current 60 cycle conduction along the ionized path. That could be
    deadly..... </p>

<p><a name="burns"><b>2.0) Burns</b></a></p>
<p>Tesla coils can cause burns, especially due to RF discharges from the
    secondary. Stay out of the immediate vicinity of a tesla coil. Remember, if you
    do get zapped by a large coil system, the heating effects may be mostly internal,
    causing lasting damage! Also remember that spark gaps and rotaries get hot
    and are a potential source of burns. </p>
<p><a href="safety.htm#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<p><a name="induction"><b>3.0) Induction Field Effects</b></a></p>
<p>Tesla coils operate in a pulsed mode, and strong electric and magnetic fields
    are locally produced. In addition, significant amounts of RF may be produced if
    the grounding is poor, or before spark breakout. This can result in induced
    currents in other conductors, like test equipment, nearby computers and
    electronics, and metal structures in the facility. The end result is generally bad.
    Turn off computers and sensitive test equipment, and move it away from the
    vicinity of your coils. If you foolishly choose to use your house electrical ground
    as your RF ground, you are asking for trouble. Currents may be induced
    anywhere in the building, and voltage standing waves along the wiring may
    destroy electronics far from the coil location. Construct a dedicated RF ground,
    and make sure it is properly connected before firing any coil of substantial size. </p>
<p>Fire from other induced currents. </p>
<p>Tesla coils are good at inducing currents. Beware of metal things that are
    connected to the same ground as a tesla coil. For example, I run my coil in my
    garage, which has a wooden door on metal tracks. The tracks are against the
    concrete floor, and near the strap that serves as a ground for my coil. When the
    coil operates, it causes sparks to jump between the running hardware of the
    door and the tracks. </p>
<p>Static charges </p>
<p>During the operation of the tesla coil, significant static charges can build up on
    the secondary. If you need to move the secondary (say you are adjusting the
    coupling), you may get a nasty zap right across your chest when you pick it up
    with both hands. Before you touch the secondary, wipe it lightly with a
    grounded wire. You can sometimes hear the crackling as you do so. Besides
    the shock hazard, there is the physical hazard caused by the shock. You will
    likely drop the secondary or jump onto something that isn't soft. </p>
<p>Hazards to electronics </p>
<p>Strikes to house electrical ground -- also goes to power(?) A tesla coil must be
    connected to a ground that is separate from the house ground or water pipes.
    Connecting your coil to either of these grounds is a recipe for disaster. Notice
    that your stereo, computer, VCR, etc., have three prong plugs. Also, note
    where your telephone box is grounded. It is likely grounded to the water pipes. </p>
<p>Consider what happens when your coil strikes the grounded strike rail, or an
    unexpectedly long spark that hits an electrical receptacle. That enormous
    voltage at high frequency will now be connected to the grounds of all your
    electronic goodies or your telephone. Furthermore, a spark is a conducting
    path in the atmosphere. By creating this path, you open your electrical system
    up to connections among the 120/220v house system and ground. </p>
<p>Strikes to garage door opener rails. Since many people do their coiling in the
    garage, this topic deserves individual consideration. If you have a garage door
    opener, or are installing one, you should put in a mechanism, such as a switch
    or plug and socket, that allows you to disconnect the opener from the house
    power. </p>
<p>My garage door got zapped by my coil. The door is connected to the opener
    track so the opener got zapped too. The strike caused the opener to attempt to
    open the already open door. Since the door couldn't go any further, the opener
    started binding. I was able to unplug the opener and keep the thing from
    smoking. </p>
<p>More than one person on the list has replaced their opener as a result of their
    coiling activity. Be warned of the dangers to the equipment. An untested
    suggestion is to put a grounded wire underneath the rail and opener to draw the
    sparks to the wire. </p>
<p>Electric fields inducing currents and killing sensitive meters. Oddly enough
    sensitive meters and measuring equipment are just that -- sensitive. Solid state
    instruments are much more susceptible to damage from being near tesla coils
    than are vacuum tube items. Consider purchasing a cheap volt-ohmeter (VOM)
    with an analog meter movement. If will survive in places many digital units will
    not. A used vacuum tube oscilloscope is also more likely to survive the tesla
    coil environment and can be obtained cheaply at hamfests. </p>
<p>Good electrical practice </p>
<p>Place your coil in a location that will prevent the strikes from hitting electrical
    outlets, people, animals, and sensitive electrical equipment. Turn off and unplug
    computers in your house. </p>
<p><a href="safety.htm#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<p><a name="ozone"><b>4.0) Ozone, Nitrites, and Vapors</b></a></p>
<p>A sparking tesla coil produces ozone, nitrites, and probably a host of other
    potentially toxic substances. Do not operate a large coil in an enclosed area for
    long periods of time. Make sure ventilation is adequate at all times. There have
    been anecdotal references to people becoming ill due to ozone toxicity. The
    long term bioeffects are unknown. (On the other hand, it does help out the
    ozone layer!) When constructing secondaries, use adequate ventilation when
    coating coils with varnish, etc. Some of these materials are also quite toxic. The
    flux from solder is also potentially hazardous. </p>
<p><a href="safety.htm#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<p><a name="uvligh"><b>5.0) Ultraviolet Light and X-ray Production</b></a></p>
<p>Ultraviolet light may be produced by the spark gap during operation of a tesla
    coil. The human eye has no pain sensors within it, so the bioeffects are felt later,
    when it is too late. (Ever look at the sun for a while, or watch a welder at
    work?) The light produced in a spark gap is essentially identical to that
    produced by an arc welder, containing substantial amounts of hard ultraviolet
    light. As any professional arc welder will tell you &quot;Don't Look At The Arc!&quot;
    Spark gaps produce a large amount of UV and visible light. The visible light is
    extremely bright, and the ultraviolet light will damage your eyes, and can cause
    skin cancer. The arc is so bright that you couldn't make out any detail anyway,
    so why bother? If you must study your spark gap, use welder's glasses.
    Generally, it is not too difficult to rig up a piece of plastic, cardboard, etc. that
    will shield yourself and others. </p>
<p>X-rays </p>
<p>X-rays can be produced whenever there is a high voltage present. Although a
    number of coilers have tested their coils for x-ray radiation and found none
    present that is not to say that x-rays cannot be produced, especially if vacuum
    tubes, light bulbs, and other evacuated vessels are placed near a coil. Here is a
    little information about X-rays. </p>
<p>X-ray Production </p>
<p>A number of vacuum tubes work pretty well as X-ray tubes, and several
    articles have appeared in Scientific American magazine in the distant past.
    X-rays are typically produced by slamming electrons into either the nuclei or
    inner shell electrons of atoms. The source electrons are usually boiled off a
    heated filament (cathode), and accelerated toward an anode via some large
    potential difference, typically 25-150 kV in the medical world. Basically, any
    time the voltage gets above 10 kV, there is a significant risk of X-ray
    production, and the risk increases with increasing voltages. You can also get
    some X-ray production via field emission, whereby electrons escape a cold
    metal due to very high local electric fields (the Schottky effect). This was
    probably the type of emission obtained by an amateur described recently on the
    list. For the remainder of this discussion I will limit my comments to
    conventional X-ray tubes, using a filament and anode, although most of it
    applies to both forms. The target or anode is normally a high atomic number
    material like tungsten. X-ray production is relatively inefficient, so most of the
    energy is wasted as heat (typically about 99% with good X-ray tubes).
    Tungsten works well because of its high melting point (to absorb all that wasted
    heat energy). If the potential difference between the anode and cathode is +100
    kV D.C., a spectrum of X-rays will be produced with energies from zero to
    100 keV. The graph of the number of X-rays produced (y-axis) versus X-ray
    energy (x-axis) has a negative slope with a Y=0 point at x = 100 keV. Hence,
    many more low energy X-rays are produced than high energy X-rays. Some of
    these low energy photons are absorbed by the tube housing. In a clinical X-ray
    machine, the tube is placed in a leaded shield with a window (hole) in it for the
    X-rays to escape through. This window has a piece of aluminum over it to
    further attenuate the low energy X-rays. In conventional equipment, the tube,
    housing and aluminum filter accounts for about 2.5 - 3.5 mm of aluminum
    equivalent material in the exit port. This effectively knocks out most of the low
    energy (&lt;10 keV) radiation, which would be absorbed in the patient and could
    not contribute to producing an image anyway. </p>
<p>X-ray Absorption </p>
<p>High atomic number materials readily absorb x-ray radiation. There is an
    energy dependence here, as high energy X-rays are more penetrating than low
    energy x-rays. For example, the percentage of radiation which will pass through
    10 cm (about 4 inches) of water is 0.04% at 20 keV, 10% at 50 keV and 18%
    at 100 keV. Compare this with 1 mm of lead (about 0.04 inches), which
    transmits 0.02% at 50 keV and 0.14% at 100 keV. The human body absorbs
    X-rays pretty readily (similar to water), but becomes more transparent as the
    energy of the X-ray increases. That is why we use 50-150 keV for many
    clinical procedures. The low energy X-rays are filtered out of the spectrum
    before they enter the patient, usually through the use of an aluminum filter,
    which lets the high energy X-rays pass through with little attenuation (except
    possibly to give you enough contrast to see what you want). Most of the x-rays
    are absorbed in the patient, with 1-5% exiting the patient typically. Low energy
    X-rays (0-15 keV) are totally absorbed in human skin near the skin surface,
    and would contribute substantially to patient dose if allowed to reach the
    patient. This is to be avoided in general! </p>
<p>Shielding </p>
<p>The best materials are lead or depleted (nonradioactive) uranium. Concrete and
    steel also work pretty well. Aluminum is a poor absorber of radiation, unless
    the radiation is very low in energy. Most plastics are similar to water in
    attenuating properties (quite poor). </p>
<p>Hazards </p>
<p>X-rays are capable of producing ionizations, which means that the electrons
    can be stripped off of atoms when an x-ray is absorbed in a material. This
    results in the production of chemically reactive free radicals, and the direct
    disruption of chemical bonds. This is generally bad in humans, causing cancer,
    leukemia cataracts, etc. However, due to natural background radiation levels,
    humans have built in radiation repair mechanisms and can handle low doses of
    radiation quite well. Bio-effects are not generally observed for doses of less
    than 25 rem. Skin reddening occurs with doses of around 300 rem or so.
    Natural background radiation levels typically contribute 0.2 - 0.5 rem per year.
    Most regulatory agencies recommend no more than 0.5 rem per year above
    background radiation levels for the general public. Occupational radiation
    workers can get 5 rem per year above background. The radiation from a well
    designed X-ray tube can be as high as 10-50 rem per minute of exposure, at a
    distance of 1/2 meter. The radiation source acts like a light bulb, decreasing in
    intensity via the square law with distance. Hence, don't stand close to a
    possible radiation source, use adequate shielding and minimize the exposure
    time. Incidentally produced radiation from metal objects other than X-ray tubes
    will generally be at much lower production levels, but should be avoided,
    nonetheless. </p>
<p>Regulations </p>
<p>In the U.S. the individual states regulate X-ray machines. They generally keep
    close tabs on clinical and industrial X-ray machines and aren't too impressed to
    see them in the hands of people without the appropriate licenses. If you happen
    across an old X-ray tube, you might consider releasing the high vacuum inside
    (very carefully, please) so that it is inoperable, and a little safer to handle for
    show and tell (and much more acceptable to the regulators). This can be done
    by making a small hole in the glass envelope with a file, keeping the tube
    wrapped in a large quantity of towels for implosion protection during the
    process. (It goes without saying that you should always have your favorite
    towel handy anyway [for you Doug Adams fans]). </p>
<p>Monitoring </p>
<p>At this point I presume you are wondering how to tell if that great apparatus in
    your basement or garage is producing X-rays. There are several ways to tell.
    First, go look for a surplus Geiger-Mueller counter at your local hamfest or
    make friends with someone in your local fire department, since many fire
    departments have radiation survey meters at their stations (in case we have a
    nearby nuclear explosion, etc.). (Don't bother with the fire department if your
    apparatus is likely to upset them!) In addition, nearly every hospital has a
    radiation safety officer who is likely to be more than willing to take a look at
    your toys, and will bring a radiation survey meter along. The standard method
    for monitoring radiation dose is via film badge and/or thermoluminescent
    dosimetry monitors, but these are not all that useful to the experimenter since
    they must be mailed back to the dosimetry lab for reading. In general, film is
    quite insensitive to radiation, and is of limited value in the experimenters setting
    unless you can leave the equipment on for a long time to get adequate
    exposure. Cloud chambers are great fun and can detect a variety of radiation
    particles, but get easily overwhelmed by devices that put out even low radiation
    levels. If you don't expect any radiation but still want to check, a cloud
    chamber can be used. Buy a thorium doped lantern mantle at your local
    camping store to use as a radiation check source to make sure your chamber is
    working okay before you power up your equipment. Another possibility is to
    construct an electroscope and place it near your apparatus. An electroscope
    measures the amount of charge using two thin metal foils which are charged up
    to a high potential, causing them to swing apart due to repulsion of like charges.
    Radiation ionizes the air in the electroscope chamber, causing a loss of charge
    on the foils. Naturally, this type of equipment has limited utility in the direct
    vicinity of high voltage equipment if electric fields are significant. </p>
<p>X-rays and Tesla Coils </p>
<p>I have monitored my various tesla coils using a number of different radiation
    instruments and have not seen measurable radiation levels. My coils produce 3
    to 5 foot sparks in magnifier and conventional forms using up to 15 kV input,
    with power levels of no more than 1.5 kVA. Obviously, you don't want to get a
    survey meter too close to an operating tesla coil. </p>
<p>Finally, always keep safety in mind with all of this equipment. Humans are not
    able to sense X-ray and ultraviolet radiation. If you think you are producing
    some, use an appropriate instrument to find out for sure. </p>

<p><a name="RFI"><b>6.0) Radio Frequency Interference</b></a></p>
<p>Tesla coils are generally inefficient as antennas go, but can still produce a fair
    amount of RF, especially if operated with a large top capacitance, before spark
    breakout. Significant quantities of RF can also be produced if the RF grounding
    is inadequate. This can cause interference with TV's, radios, and other
    electronics. If you note interference, try to improve your ground first, since that
    is likely where your problem is. In addition, every tesla coil should be wired
    with a power line conditioner in series with the primary circuit. These are
    relatively inexpensive and are very effective in keeping RF out of the house
    wiring. </p>
<p>Legal dangers </p>
<p>In the United States, RF transmitters are regulated by the Federal
    Communications Commission ( FCC), and they generally aren't keen on any
    type of RF interference. They have specific rules which prohibit the operation
    of spark gap type damped oscillators, dating back to the early days of radio.
    Make sure you operate your coil with a good RF ground. If interference still
    exists, construct a Faraday cage from chicken wire or similar material, which
    should eliminate the interference. </p>
<p>Other Comments </p>
<p>When I first got interested in tesla coils, I called the FCC to ask about the legal
    aspects of coiling. While the man that I talked to wasn't too sure about the
    potential interference, he did say that modulation of the output is definitely
    illegal. Of course, if you shield your coil from emitting RF to the outside world,
    you can do anything you like. </p>
<p>Try to be aware that your coil may cause various interference problems. If you
    know about any, take care to eliminate them if possible before they figure out
    who caused it. </p>
<p><a name="fire"><b>7.0) Fire Hazards</b></a></p>
<p>The danger of fires is substantial with tesla coils! Make sure you have a
    functional fire extinguisher designed for fighting electrical fires handy. Fires can
    be caused by an overheated spark gap, equipment failure (e.g., shorted
    transformer), corona discharge, induced currents, to name a few causes. </p>
<p>Fire starting from sparks to flammable points. The sparks from a tesla coil are
    hot. Depending on where they strike, these sparks can cause a fire. Richard
    Hull has captured fires caused by sparks from his coils on video tape. (This
    was due to a failed power line conditioner.) </p>
<p>Be sure that when you run your coil, that there are no flammable substances
    around. For example, gas cans (e.g., for a lawnmower), ammunition, sawdust,
    fireworks, etc. Walls and ceilings can also be ignited, so keep the fire
    extinguisher handy. </p>
<p>Gasoline on premises (mowers, etc.) Without a spark, what's a tesla coil?
    What's it take to ignite gasoline? Consider the location of gas cans,
    lawnmowers, etc. when operating your coil. Remember that when you operate
    your coil, it's usually in the dark with plenty of exposed high voltage wires. Not
    a good combination for fighting a fire in your garage. </p>
<p>In addition, most coilers use polyethylene and other plastics in constructing their
    coils, capacitors, and other equipment. These plastics ignite at relatively low
    temperatures, and produce large quantities of toxic smoke. </p>
<p><a href="safety.htm#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<p><a name="chemical"><b>8.0) Chemical Hazards</b></a></p>
<p>Old capacitors and transformers often used PCB oils for insulation. This oil is a
    known carcinogen. Similarly, the materials used to coat coils (e.g., varnish) may
    contain hazardous chemicals. Consult a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)
    for any materials you have questions about. (Many of these are available via
    Internet. Use your favorite Web search engine with the key word MSDS'.)
    Some forms of solder contain lead, which is also generally bad for humans. </p>
<p><a href="safety.htm#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<p><a name="explosion"><b>9.0) Explosion Hazards</b></a></p>
<p>Explosions can and do occur with tesla coils! The rotary gap and capacitors
    are the most frequent culprits, but nearby flammables are also at risk. </p>
<p>Rotary gaps </p>
<p>During operation, rotary gaps spin at high speeds. The spinning rotor or disk is
    subjected to tremendous force. At a modest 3600 RPM, the periphery of a 10&quot;
    disk is subjected to a force of 1835 G's. A 5 gram (0.011 lb) 1/4-20 brass
    acorn nut used as an electrode will exert a force of over 20 pounds. The
    peripheral speed of the 10&quot; disk is 107 MPH. At 10000 RPM, the edge of the
    disk is running at about 300 MPH! </p>
<p>All these numbers translate into one thing: Danger. </p>
<p>The best way to guard against this danger is to shield the rotor and build the
    entire system carefully and take pains to balance it. The shielding must be nearly
    bullet proof (literally). Lexan (polycarbonate) is an excellent plastic for
    shielding. It is non-conductive, strong, and tough. Consult with your plastics
    dealer to determine what thickness you need. </p>
<p>Capacitors </p>
<p>Capacitors are great at releasing energy very quickly. The explosion danger in a
    capacitor occurs when it shorts out and suddenly produces a large volume of
    hot vaporized gas. Since capacitors are usually in an airtight container, the
    volume of gas will cause the container to explode, sending pieces of solid cap
    guts and oil all over. </p>
<p>One recommended method of shielding capacitors is in an HDPE (High Density
    PolyEthylene) pipe. These pipes are used in the pyrotechnics industry as
    mortars because of their strength and the fact that they don't create shrapnel as
    steel or PVC pipes do. </p>
<p>Also, avoid storing gasoline or other flammables near a tesla coil! </p>

<p><a name="noise"><b>10.0) Noise Hazards</b></a></p>
<p>Tesla coils produce a lot of noise, and large coils can damage one's hearing. Go
    to your local gun shop and buy ear protection if you operate large coils. </p>
<p>One type of spark gap, the air blast gap, produces a loud noise. Buy and use a
    set of ear muffs or ear plugs. There are a wide variety of types of ear plugs and
    muffs, so you will likely find one that works well and is comfortable. I prefer the
    roll up foam type myself. If you are on a tight budget (blew all the $$$'s on the
    pig), you can wash the foam ear plugs. Just put them in a pants pocket (one
    that closes is best) and run the pants through the wash. Works great. </p>
<p>When a coil is in tune, you will notice a dramatic increase in the noise level as it
    sparks. This noise is loud enough that it can damage hearing. See the warnings
    in the previous paragraph. </p>
<p>Hearing is important -- how will you tell if your teenager is mocking you behind
    your back without it? </p>
<p><a href="safety.htm#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<p><a name="neighbors"><b>11.0) Neighbors, The Spouse, and Children</b></a></p>
<p>While the beauty of a tesla coil firing outside is something to behold, often your
    neighbors will not see it that way, and your local police will make a personal
    house call. Be cognizant of your possibly unreasonable neighbors, and do your
    work inside if possible, or invite them over and explain things before you start.
    Attitudes are a lot different if a little common sense is used first. </p>
<p>Coils are noisy </p>
<p>Please consider your neighbor's sleep habits. </p>
<p>Remember the following: </p>
<p>&#168; For new parents, sleep is the most precious commodity that they have. </p>
<p>&#168; Not everyone works 8am to 5pm. </p>
<p>&#168; Not everyone is tolerant or nice. </p>
<p>A potential secondary hazard would be from enraged neighbors if radio or TV
    interference was generated often enough to be a nuisance, and said neighbors
    could trace it to its source. Good citizenship will solve this problem (or a large
    building with a good RF ground and a batch of power line filters). </p>
<p>Kids, small pets </p>
<p>Kids and small pets are quite curious, innocent, and ignorant. (Note the
    similarity!) Their judgment isn't the greatest either. If you have children and they
    have access to your coil, install some sort of key lock on your power cabinet,
    variac, or whatever. Killing or injuring a child or pet, be it yours or neighbors,
    will most likely be the worst thing that will happen to you in your life. </p>
<p>The Spouse </p>
<p>Another potential hazard is if the spouse thinks one is spending too much time
    on his or her hobby. ANY HOBBY!!!! Expect the wife to not understand! </p>
<p><a href="safety.htm#contents">Back to contents</a></p>
<p><a name="other"><b>11) Other</b></a></p>
<p>Whenever possible, have a buddy assist you. Most coilers prefer to operate
    their coils with the lights off, which is inherently dangerous. This situation can be
    improved by having an assistant around to operate the lights and/or power
    switch. Also, have your buddy learn CPR, and post your local emergency
    telephone numbers, just to be safe. </p>
<p>The layout of your apparatus is also a safety consideration. Many coilers throw
    their systems together using electrical tape, hot glue, and assorted bits of
    plastic. If things move around a bit during firing, the risk of something bad
    occurring is increased significantly. Spend a little time to construct yourself a
    nice power cabinet with a safety switch, and construct a safe high voltage
    transmission line to your coil. </p>
<p>Drinking and coiling can be lethal! If you feel the need to consume some mind
    altering drugs, watch a tesla video instead! Never operate a tesla coil while
    under the influence! Quaff the ales later during bragging hour, not when you are
    actually working. </p>
