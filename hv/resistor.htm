<h3>High Voltage Resistors</h3>
<p>Even such a mundane component as a resistor has special requirements when it
    comes to high voltage applications. The usual little 1/4 watt carbon film resistor
    used in most other electronics is only rated to 250 or 500 volts, a far cry from
    the kilovolt levels needed. The voltage limitation is usually set by power
    dissipation issues: a 10K resistor with 1 kV across it dissipates 100 watts!
    And, of course, the physical length of the device of around a centimeter means
    that around 5-10 kV, arcing around the resistor body is a significant problem.
    There are a number of manufacturers of resistors intended specifically for high
    voltage applications, and of course, you can construct a resistor suitable for
    your application.</p>
<h4>Commercial products</h4>
<ul>
    <li>High resistance, low power - These are typically used for measuring high
        voltages as part of a voltage divider (or as a meter series multiplier). Generally
        constructed by thin film techniques on a ceramic substrate of appropriate
        size for the voltage rating. Suppliers include Caddock, Gigohm, Victoreen...
    </li>
    <li>High precision - Used in precision voltage dividers for measurement applications
        (Caddock, Victoreen)
    </li>
    <li>High power - Typified by the products of the Kanthal Globar (formerly Cesewid,
        formerly Carborundum), these units are designed to take large peak or average
        powers and are often constructed so they are non-inductive. A typical application
        would be as a current limiting device in a capacitor discharge circuit, components
        in pulse forming/shaping networks, or as a energy dump load. Suppliers include
        Globar and Maxwell Labs.. (<a href="http://www.globar.com/resistor.htm" target="_blank">http://www.globar.com/resistor.htm</a>)
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Home built</h4>

    <li>Using conventional products well beyond their catalog ratings - The
        power dissipation and breakdown voltage issues may be addressed by
        potting or immersing the resistor in some suitable substance: silicone, oil,
        high pressure gas, etc. You'll need to do some engineering and/or testing
        on the system to make sure it will work as planned, e.g. potting in
        silicone may increase the breakdown voltage, but will reduce the max
        power dissipation. There are some good <a href="resww.htm">reasons not to use wirewound
            power resistors</a>, even though their nominal breakdown voltage is fairly
        high.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Strings of small low voltage resistors work very nicely, although their
        construction is labor intensive. This is a popular way to make high
        precision voltage dividers, because you can inexpensively obtain high
        precision resistors, and the whole assembly can be potted to reduce
        corona problems. Important design issues which need calculation include
        power dissipation, breakdown voltage, and overall precision.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Water resistors - Actually water and some ionic salt, these are usually
        self constructed and are generally of low resistance. Accurate resistance
        control and stability is hard to achieve, but there are many applications
        which don't require accuracy, including charging resistors for capacitor
        banks and energy dump loads. I've gathered some design criteria,
        equations and a discussion on construction details into a <a href="rwater.htm">summary</a>.
