<h3>Pelletron</h3>
<p>&#160;The Pelletron (a tm of National Electrostatics Corp) is a much improved form of the Van de Graaf
    generator. It uses a chain of conductive pellets separated by insulating links to replace the belt of a
    Van de Graaf. The chain allows much higher charging currents and is mechanically more rugged,
    particularly with respect to sparking. Pelletron actually refers to a whole series of electrostatic
    accelerators built by NEC with a number of improvements beyond the charging system, like the
    accelerator tubes, pumping systems, insulation and mechanical structures, etc.</p>
<p>Pelletron usage has greatly increased in the last few decades with materials science applications
    being quite popular.</p>
<p>A review paper on Pelletrons (by the man who invented them) is: Herb, R.G. &quot;Pelletron
    Accelerators for Very High Voltage&quot;, <em>Nuclear Instruments and Methods</em>, v. <strong>122</strong>, pp 267-276,
    1974&#160;</p>
<p>And of course, another resource would be the manufacturer: <a href="supplier.htm#NEC">National Electrostatics Corporation</a></p>
<p>&#160;Relevant patents are:</p>
<p>&#160;TBD</p>
