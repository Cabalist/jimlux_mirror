<p>Energy is stored in primary C</p>
<h4>first half cycle (0 degrees)</h4>
<p>spark gap breaks down</p>
<p>energy flows from primary C into primary L</p>
<p>some couples to secondary L (roughly 20%, assuming k=0.2)</p>
<h4>half cycle peaks (90 degrees) (max current in L)</h4>
<p>primary L energy flows back to primary C (the 80% remaining, less losses in
    spark gap)</p>
<p>secondary L energy flows to secondary C (partly self, partly top load), raising
    its voltage</p>
<p>Air breaks down next to secondary C (charge/current flows out from topload,
    limiting the voltage rise)</p>
<h4>zero crossing (180 degrees) (max voltage on C)</h4>
<p>voltage starts to drop on topload, charge stops flowing into spark, but hot
    gas remains</p>
<p>energy flows back into primary L from primary C </p>
<p>remaining energy (that didn't go into making the spark) in secondary C flows
    back into secondary L, some dissipated as heat in the windings</p>
<p>some additional energy is added to secondary L by coupling from primary L (20%
    of the 75-80%, or 16% of original Cpri energy)</p>
<h4>second half cycle peaks (270 degrees) (max current in L)</h4>
<p>primary L energy flows back to primary C</p>
<p>secondary L energy flows back to secondary C, raising its voltage, continuing
    the spark growth.</p>
