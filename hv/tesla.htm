<h3>Tesla Coils</h3>
<p>Invented by Nikola Tesla in the 19th century, and much beloved of science fiction
    film makers of the 30's and 40's, as well as hv experimenters of today, the
    Tesla coil is an inexpensive way to generate very high voltages (hundreds of
    kV, at least) at low radio frequencies. A tesla coil is basically an air core
    transformer or two coupled inductors with capacitors chosen to resonate at the
    same frequency, typically a few hundred kHz. In the classic spark gap coil,
    the low voltage primary is driven as a spark gap oscillator: a transformer with
    5-20kV charges the capacitor, and when the voltage gets high enough, the gap
    breaks down, forming a LC resonant circuit. The energy is coupled out of the
    primary LC into the secondary LC (typically with a coupling coefficient around
    0.1 to 0.2). Since the secondary has much higher L and much smaller C, the voltage
    is higher, for the same energy.</p>
<p>There is an immense amount of information on Tesla coils available on the web,
    some of it good, some of it positive dreck. Start at the Tesla Coil Mailing
    List: <a href="http://www.pupman.com/">http://www.pupman.com/</a>, which has
    great (searchable) archives, and some helpful design spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Basic design is simple, and optimization is really a matter of choosing values
    that are convenient and buildable. You want low loss in your spark gap. You
    want the coupling to be such that the energy transfers from primary to secondary
    as the spark from the secondary grows, otherwise, the voltage on the secondary
    rises too fast, and you get the dreaded &quot;racing sparks&quot; down the secondary
    coil. </p>
<p>Here is a simple 3 pipe static gap which I have found works pretty well, especially
    with a muffin fan blowing the length of the pipes. It's easily adjustable and
    has good thermal properties. It's a whole lot better than the &quot;two bolts&quot;
    kind of gap which a lot of people start with. That particular gap winds up getting
    hot and having problems &quot;quenching&quot; (i.e. you want the gap to stop
    conducting, so that the primary capacitor can charge again)</p>

<p>Several people have built <a href="blastgap.htm">blast gaps</a> and/or <a href="hvtrigsg.htm">triggered
    gaps</a> for Tesla coils, some based on the pages here. And, of course, the
    ever popular <a href="rotgap.htm">rotary gap</a>.</p>
<p>Standard formulae for <a href="wheeler.htm">inductance are from Wheeler</a>

wave thing (I'm so embarassed that it's been up that long)<br>
