<h3>Transformer Measurements</h3>
<p>You may want to determine the various parameters of a
    transformer without having any manufacturer's information
    available. In the early stages of experimentation, you may be
    working with equipment and components that have been
    &quot;acquired&quot; from other projects as surplus. Or, you may
    be at a surplus yard, and want to determine if that transformer
    you can pick up cheap is going to work for your needs. I own a
    lot of very heavy scrap now, having bought a number of
    transformers on spec, hoping they would work for my needs.</p>
<p>You'll need a variable voltage AC source (like a variac), a
    voltmeter, an ammeter, and for some measurements either a watt
    meter or an oscilloscope. A couple of big power resistors in low
    resistances (100 ohms, 100 W) will also be useful.</p>
<p>Often, the nameplate or markings on the transformer don't tell
    you everything you would like to know, particularly in the case
    of surplus.</p>
<p>Per Unit system of ratings - commercial power distribution
    transformers have fairly complete data on their nameplates, but
    it is often stated in terms &quot;per unit&quot;. Per Unit
    measurements are essentially percentages of the rated capacity.
    For instance, a power transformer might be rated at 10 kVA, and
    have a rated loss of .03 per unit. 10 kVA multiplied by the .03
    gives a rated loss of 300 Watts. Impedances are also usually
    stated in per unit values</p>
<p>First, you need to identify the windings. An ohmmeter can help
    you determine which wires are connected to which windings, by
    looking for continuity. Sometimes, you can determine the order of
    taps by the resistances. However, the resistance is affected by
    the size of the wire, as well as the number of turns, so you
    can't use the ohmmeter to determine voltages or currents. In
    general, the heavy wires or terminals are for the low voltage
    windings. A notable exception is some power supply transformers
    that have some medium voltage windings to provide isolated bias
    supplies at low currents.</p>
<p>Almost all the parameters of the transformer can be determined
    by making a series of measurements with the secondary open
    circuited and then shorted. The choice of which winding is
    primary and secondary is arbitrary for measurement purposes. For
    commercial distribution transformers, these measurements are
    often made at 115 Volts, as measurement equipment is readily
    available for that voltage. In the case of a transformer with a
    HV winding and a LV winding, the 115 Volts is applied to the HV
    winding for safety reasons. In the lab, lower voltages are
    convenient: using 1.15 Volts or 11.5 Volts allows simple scaling
    of the results.</p>

<p>First, identify windings and approximate no load turns ratios.
    Apply a low voltage (say 10 volts) to what you think a high
    voltage winding might be. Measure the voltages on the other
    windings. You use the high voltage side here for safety: Say you
    had a 110V:15kV transformer with a 6.3V filament winding. If you
    applied 10 volts to the 6.3V winding, you'll get 20 kV+ out of
    the high voltage winding which might cause a few surprises. So,
    until you've identified all the windings, work with low voltages.</p>

        alt="Open Secondary Measurements" align="bottom" width="321"
        height="126"></p>
<p>Hook up a voltmeter to the secondary. Apply power to the
    primary, measuring the current, voltage, and active power drawn.
    Note the power meter shown in the above diagram. If a true watt
    meter is not available, you can measure the active power
    consumption by putting a resistor in series, and making a set of
    RMS measurements. The details of this procedure are described <a
            href="varvom.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>The turns ratio can be calculated by:</p>
<p>Turns ratio = Esec/Epri</p>
<p>which, of course, should be an integer. Be aware that the
    output voltage written on the spec sheet or the transformer
    itself may be at rated load, and somewhat less than the no load
    voltage. The active power drawn is due to the core losses, and
    will typically be a few percent of the rated capacity.</p>
<p>The magnetizing power is:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Now, disconnect the primary voltage. Short the secondary
    through an ammeter. </p>

              height="126"></p>
<p>Starting with a low primary voltage, bring the primary voltage
    up until the current is a reasonable value, say half the rated
    primary current. Measure the secondary current (which should be
    the primary current divided by the turns ratio), the primary
    voltage, current, and active power.</p>

<h4>Circular Mils</h4>
<p>The area of conductors is often specified in Circular Mils,
    defined as the diameter in thousandths of an inch (mils) squared.
    This is different from the actual cross sectional area in square
    mils, which would be PI/4 * diam^2. That is, square mils = .7854
    * circular mils.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h4>Estimating the power handling</h4>
<p>1) Look at the size of the wires. No right thinking
    transformer manufacturer is going to run hundreds of amps down 20
    gauge wires, nor are they going to use 4/0 wire for a winding
    that will carry 30 mA. Very low current windings may use heavier
    wire than required to carry the current to make fabrication
    easier. However, copper costs money, as does a larger core to
    accommodate bigger windings, so particularly for mass production
    transformers, the wire is probably the smallest that will carry
    the current. Typical design guidelines are 700 circular mils/amp
    or 1000 cmil/amp. The following table relates common wire gauges
    to rated current.</p>

<p>2) Look at the core cross section:</p>
<p>Here are some approximate transformer design equations that
    will get you into the right area:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Core cross section area (sq inch) = .16 * sqrt( VA)</li>
    <li>Turns/Volt = 5 / Core cross section</li>
</ul>
<p>This last equation is a special case of:</p>
<p>Voltage = 4 * F * f * a * B * N * 1E-8</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>F = Form factor, typically around 1.11</p>
<p>f = frequency in Hz</p>
<p>a = core cross sectional area in sq inch</p>
<p>B = flux per square inch (typ 75,000)</p>
<p>N = number of turns</p>
