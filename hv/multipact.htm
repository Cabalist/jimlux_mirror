<h2>Multipaction</h2>
<p>Multipaction is an effect that occurs with RF fields, usually in a vacuum or
    low pressure condition. Essentially it results from an ion moving back and forth
    (in response to an RF field) and knocking other electrons off the sides when
    it hits. If the transit time of the electron is nicely synchronized with the
    RF field, then just as it hits, the field is right to pull the new electrons
    towards the other side, and a cascading avalanche can result (if the electron
    emission coefficient (greek lower case delta) is &gt;1). The table below gives
    values for clean, outgassed surfaces. Bear in mind that without special cleaning,
    surfaces can have a delta as high as 4.</p>

<p>As the number of electrons bouncing back and forth grows, the current can increase
    to the point where a hot spot forms on the cavity wall, increasing outgassing,
    melting the wall, evaporating material, and all manner of &quot;bad things.&quot;</p>
<p>A bunch of math will result in a handy equation, often referred to as the multipactoring
    threshold:</p>
<p>Vo = (2*pi*d/lambda)^2 * (me*c^2)/(pi*e)</p>
<p>where:<br>
    Vo is the voltage between the sides of the cavity<br>
    me= mass of electron<br>
    lambda = wavelength<br>
    d = spacing between walls<br>
    c = speed of light (3E8 m/sec)<br>
    e = charge on an electron</p>
<p>The secondary electron emission actually goes down as the electron energy rises
    over the peak, so breakdown can sometimes be avoided by rapidly raising the
    RF power (as in a pulsed radar system, for instance).</p>
<p>If the pressure is high, then the electron will likely hit another gas molecule
    or atom before hitting the other side, so multipaction is less likely. Therefore,
    the mean free path would need to be on the order of the spacing for multipaction
    to occur.</p>
<p>Interestingly, aluminum seems to have a really high secondary emission coefficient,
    a good reason for plating it with something else in a waveguide intended for
    use in vacuum.</p>
