<h3>Multi-Stage High Voltage Generators</h3>
<p>Multistage HV generators create high voltage by connecting a number of lower
    voltage sources in series to produce the required voltage. At some voltage level,
    it becomes impractical to generate the required voltage in one circuit, usually
    due to component construction and insulation problems, so a multistage approach
    is the only way to get the voltages required. There are also some applications,
    linear particle accelerators and photomultiplier dynode bias supplies being
    two notable ones, where you actually want a series of stepped voltages. The
    fact that the power supply creates them without needing some sort of external
    voltage divider (which will potentially dissipate some power) is an advantage.
    The best known form of a multistage HV generator is the <a href="cw1.htm">Cockroft-Walton
        voltage multiplier</a>, which will be discussed in a later section.</p>
<p>Modern HV power supplies now make use of pulse width modulated (PWM) switching
    techniques, and, of course, there are specialized techniques for <a href="pwm.htm">HV
        PWM supplies</a>. PWM switchers are very popular because they run at higher
    frequencies, reducing the size of filter components required for a given ripple,
    which has the added benefit of reducing the stored energy in the supply.</p>
<p>In general, multistage generators are built as a stack of basically identical
    stages. Power is fed in at the bottom (low voltage) end of the stack and
    transmitted up the stack by some means either mechanical or electrical to
    power a series of independent power supplies. Economies of scale can be
    realized because all the stages are identical (or nearly so). Further economies
    result from the generally lower cost of lower voltage components, even in
    multiple quantities.</p>
<p>&lt;figure here&gt;</p>
<p>Start with a crude, but effective, system that uses mechanical means to transmit
    the power up the stack. A single large motor turns an insulating shaft which runs
    up the stack. At each stage, a generator is connected to the shaft and takes
    mechanical power from the shaft. The generator powers an appropriate supply
    which is connected in series with the supplies in the stages above and below.
    This system would potentially be heavy and the mechanical problems of
    transmitting significant power up an insulating shaft would need to be
    addressed. Also, electrical stability might be a problem, although with a
    sufficiently sophisticated central control and fiber optics it could probably be
    made to work quite well.</p>
<p>&lt;figure here&gt;</p>
<p>The technique of transmitting power by mechanical means has been used to
    generate isolated electrical power at high common mode voltages. For instance,
    the ion supply in the collector of a Van deGraaf accelerator is often powered
    from a generator driven by the charging belt. This technique has also been used
    to provide filament power to rectifier tubes in a more conventional Cockroft
    Walton or Greinacher stack.</p>
<p>The next system to be considered transmits the power between the stages by
    means of transformers with a high isolation voltage. This system, described by
    Greinacher in 189x (?), requires that the transformers be large enough to carry
    the power for all the stages above. So, either you give up having identical
    stages, or the transformers have a lot of excess capacity in the upper stages. It
    is a simple generalization to do the same thing using a third winding on the
    power supply transformer of the stage, essentially sharing the iron core. This
    system has the advantage that the output voltage of the entire stack can be
    easily adjusted by changing the input voltage to the first stage. company name
    here manufactures high voltage power supplies based on this principle.</p>
<p>&lt;figure here&gt;</p>
<p>Later design improvements use air core transformers operating at RF which has
    the multiple advantages of eliminating the weight of the iron and making the
    required filter capacitors much smaller, although rectifiers and other parasitic
    losses become larger at higher frequencies.</p>
<p>&lt;figure here&gt;</p>
<p>The Dynamitron takes this approach to the ultimate, using the accelerator tube
    itself as one plate of the filter capacitor.</p>
<p>&lt;figure here&gt;</p>
<p>The Cockroft Walton configuration uses a chain of capacitors to transmit the
    power up the stack. </p>

<p>&#160;Battery powered staged supplies</p>
<p>A very simple technique for generating high voltages is to cascade a number
    of battery powered supplies of lower voltage. If limited run times or power
    is needed, this can be a very simple approach.</p>
