<h3>Basic Electrostatics</h3>
<p>Electrostatics deals with charges, potentials, and the like where things aren't
    changing, i.e. they're static. Basic principles of electrostatics are used all the
    time in high voltage work for a lot of reasons. Popular high voltage generators
    like the Van de Graaf are based on electrostatic principles (even though a
    current is flowing). The burning question in a lot of high voltage work is whether
    the system will electrically breakdown as the voltage is raised. This is generally
    a question of quasi-static potential gradients which can be answered by simple
    electrostatics.</p>
<p><a href="statcalc.htm">A collection of practical calculations based on the following theory.</a></p>
<h3>Coulomb's Law</h3>
<p>The force on a charged point exerted by a second charge is proportional to the
    product of charges, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
    between the charges, and acts either directly towards each other (opposite
    charges) or away from each other (same sign of charge).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><tt>F(vector) = k * q1 * q2 / r12^2 * direction(r12)</tt></p>
<p>where</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><tt>k = 1 / (4 * pi * epsilon) = 8.99E9 Newton
        Meter^2/Coulomb^2</tt></p>
    <p>where <tt>epsilon</tt> is the dielectric constant of the medium ( =
        8.85E-12 for vacuum)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><tt>r12</tt> is the scalar distance from point 1 to point 2</p>
<p><tt>direction (r12)</tt> is a unit vector from point 1 to point 2</p>
<p>&#160;<tt>q1,q2</tt> are charges on each point</p>
<h4>Capacitance of two parallel plates</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p><tt>C = epsilon * Area / DistanceBetweenPlates</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>this neglects fringing effects, which for plates that are smaller than, say, 10 times
    the spacing, are pretty significant.</p>
<h4>Capacitance of two concentric cylinders (e.g. coaxial cable)</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p><tt>C = 2 * pi * epsilon * length / ln(
        rOuter/rInner)</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>this assumes <tt>length</tt> &gt;&gt; <tt>r</tt></p>
<h4>Capacitance of two concentric spheres</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p><tt>C = 4 * pi * epsilon * rInner * rOuter/ (rOuter
        - rInner)</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>as <tt>rOuter</tt> goes to infinity, the fraction <tt>rOuter/(rOuter-rInner)</tt> goes to
    one, leading to the following handy equation:</p>
<h4>Capacitance of isolated sphere</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p><tt>C = 4*pi*epsilon*radius = approx 111.2 pF/meter</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>this equation is derived from the equation for two concentric (nested) spheres,
    and letting the radius of the outer sphere go to infinity.</p>
