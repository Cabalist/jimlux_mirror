<h2>Estimating the magnitude of the Electric Field</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A lot of practical high voltage design requires knowing what the maximum E-field is, for insulation
    design, corona reduction, etc. The exact field can, of course, be calculated numerically by solving
    Laplace's equation over a suitable field with appropriate boundary conditions. As complicated and
    time consuming as this is, it is necessary when performance is critical, in integrated circuit design,
    designs for absolute minimum cost, and so forth. However, for more run of the mill experimentation
    and use, where a little overdesign can be tolerated, approximations to the field are just as useful.</p>
<p>The mean or average field is just the voltage difference divided by the distance between the
    conductors. For the proverbial infinite flat plates, this makes the calculation simple.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">Emax = Eaverage = V / Distance</span></p>
<h4>For two concentric cylinders (i.e. like coaxial cable) the maximum field is:</h4>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">Emax = V / ( Rinner * LN( Router / Rinner))</span></p>
<p>where:<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace">Rinner</span> is radius of the inner electrode<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace">Router</span> is the radius of the outer electrode<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace">LN()</span> is the log base e of the argument<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace">V</span> is the voltage between the electrodes</p>
<h4>For concentric spheres, using the same variables, the maximum field is:</h4>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">Emax = V * Router / (Rinner *(Router - Rinner))</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>For two parallel cylinders of equal radius:</h4>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">Emax = V * SQRT(D^2 - 4 * R^2)/ (2 * R*(D-R)*INVCOSH(D/(2*R)))</span></p>
<p>approx equal to: <span style="font-family: monospace">V / (2*R) * LN(D/R)</span> if D&gt;&gt;R</p>
<p>where:<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace">D</span> is distance between the centers of the conductors<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace">R</span> is the radius of the conductors</p>
<h4>For two spheres:</h4>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">Emax = approximately V/S * F</span><br>
</p>
<p>where:<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace">S</span> is spacing between spheres <span style="font-family: monospace">= D - 2*R</span><br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace">F</span> is a field enhancement factor = </p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">F = (S/R+1) * sqrt( (S/R+1)^2+8)/4</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For spheres, if S&gt;&gt;R then <span style="font-family: monospace">Emax = approx V/ (2*R)</span></p>
<h4>For other configurations:</h4>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">Emax = Eaverage * F</span></p>
<p>For sphere/plane: <span style="font-family: monospace">F = 0.94*Spacing/Radius + 0.8</span></p>
<p>For cylinder/plane: <span style="font-family: monospace">F = 0.25 * Spacing / Radius + 1.0</span></p>
