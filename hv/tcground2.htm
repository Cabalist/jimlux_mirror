<h2>Tesla Coil Grounding</h2>
<p>The required grounding for a tesla coil is the subject of much discussion,
    theorizing, and commotion. This page describes the various factors and things
    to consider.</p>
<p>There are three basic kinds of grounding to contemplate in respect of a tesla
    coil:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Electrical Safety Ground</li>
    <li>Grounding at the Tesla Coil Resonant Frequency (i.e. around 100 kHz)</li>
    <li>Grounding at higher frequencies (i.e. the transients from the sparks)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one is essentially a &quot;don't burn down the building&quot; and
    &quot;don't electrocute the user&quot; sort of ground, and the second two are
    more concerned with the &quot;performance&quot; of the tesla coil. However,
    we need to consider both, because they DO interact, and are often connected
    together. </p>
<h3>Electrical Safety Ground Issues</h3>
<p>Electrical Safety Ground (i.e. the &quot;green wire&quot; ground) designed
    to make sure that a presumably grounded person won't get hurt if they touch
    some part of the chassis. The safety ground is also to make sure that if there
    is an internal short from the AC power line to the chassis, that a fault current
    will flow, tripping the breaker or blowing a fuse, rather than making the outside
    case (i.e. what a person might touch) &quot;hot&quot;.</p>
<p>Another approach to this function is to &quot;double insulate&quot;, a strategy
    that is widely used on AC powered appliances (VCRs, TVs, etc.). Here the philosophy
    is that if there are two &quot;stages&quot; of insulation between the AC line
    and the case, if one stage fails, the case is still isolated from the AC line,
    and won't float hot.</p>
<p>What to watch out for: Stray capacitance from line to case.</p>
<p>Considerations for the HV secondary. In many tesla coil circuits (particularly
    those using Neon Sign Transformers), the HV transformer secondary is connected
    to the chassis or core of the transformer. This is done to reduce the peak voltage
    stress between the secondary winding and the core. However, this now means that
    the secondary is not insulated/isolated from ground.</p>
<p>Stray capacitance that would be of negligible concern at 120 or 240V is now
    a significant problem. Consider a stray capacitance of 100 pF. At 60 Hz, the
    impedance is 26 Megohm. At 240V, you'd get only 9 microAmp of leakage current.
    However, at 24 kV, the story is a bit different, because you'll get 0.9 mA,
    which something you can definitely feel, and may be enough to trip a GFCI. Let's
    look at the circuit for this last case. The red line traces the leakage current
    path. </p>

<p>What you don't want on the safety ground: RF</p>
<p>You don't want any significant RF current to flow over the safety ground wire
    for a number of reasons. First is a philosophical objection: The safety ground
    is to carry fault currents, ONLY, and shouldn't be used as an intentional circuit
    conductor. A more practical reason is that a lot of things are connected to
    that safety ground wire (like VCRs, computers, appliances, etc.). If you put
    significant RF current through the safety ground, then there will be significant
    RF voltages in the system. The typical RF bypass circuitry in consumer equipment
    is designed to deal with millivolts, not tens of volts. So, how does RF get
    onto the safety ground?</p>

<p>This figure shows a typical tesla coil circuit. The TC secondary circuit is
    composed of the inductance of the secondary in series with the capacitance of
    the secondary. That capacitance is the &quot;topload&quot; and the &quot;self
    C&quot; of the secondary, but, what's usually not stated is that the capacitance
    is with reference to the ground. There is some capacitance from the topload
    to the bottom of the secondary winding. This sort of C is what makes a bare
    coil of wire have a self-resonant frequency, but, for most TCs, there is significant
    capacitance from the topload to the ground under the coil (i.e. the floor).</p>
<p>The fact that there may be 100 feet of wire from the tesla coil, through the
    wall socket, back to the electrical panel, and then to a ground rod, doesn't
    make a huge difference. At 100 kHz, that's still a small fraction of a wavelength
    (100 kHz = 3000 meter wavelength), the DC resistance is only a tenth of an ohm
    or so, and skin effect makes the resistance maybe 2 or 3 times that. However,
    one would want to worry about the resistance of all the connections along the
    way, and what effect the capacitance from the ground wire to surrounding metal
    objects might have.</p>
<p>(just for an example, what might the typical RF current be? Assuming a 1200
    Watt input, and 120 bangs/second, each bang is 10 Joules. For a tesla coil 4&quot;
    in diameter, 20&quot; long secondary, wound with AWG24, the Lsec is around 13.4
    mH, Cself is 9.3 pF, Ctop would be around 37 pF, for a resonant frequency very
    close to 200 kHz.</p>
