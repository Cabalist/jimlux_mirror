<h2>&#160;Paschen's Law</h2>
<p>In 1889, F. Pashchen published a paper ( <em>Wied. Ann.</em>, <strong>37</strong>,
    69) (<a href="http://www.luxfamily.com/hv/paschen.pdf" target="_blank">pdf,
        2.6 MB</a>)which set out what has become known as Paschen's Law. The law essentially
    states that the breakdown characteristics of a gap are a function (generally
    not linear) of the product of the gas pressure and the gap length, usually written
    as V= f( <em>pd</em> ), where <em>p</em> is the pressure and <em>d</em> is the
    gap distance. In actuality, the pressure should probably be replaced by the
    gas density.</p>
<p>It's important to know that Paschen only worked at higher pressures (&gt;several
    Torr) and gaps of more than several mm, so the familiar &quot;Paschen curve&quot;
    with the minima is a later creation.</p>
<p>For air, and gaps on the order of a millimeter, the breakdown is roughly a linear
    function of the gap length: V = 30<em>pd</em> + 1.35 kV, where <em>d</em> is in centimeters, and <em>p</em> is
    in atmospheres.</p>
<p>Much research has been done since then to provide a theoretical basis for the law
    and to develop a greater understanding of the mechanisms of breakdown. Some of
    this will be described in the rest of this section, but it should be realized that there
    are many, many factors which have an effect on the breakdown of a gap, such as
    radiation, dust, surface irregularities. Excessive theoretical analysis might help
    understanding why a gap breaks down, but won't necessarily provide a more
    accurate value for the breakdown voltage in any given situation.</p>
<p>Paschen's Law reflects the Townsend breakdown mechanism in gases, that is, a
    cascading of secondary electrons emitted by collisions in the gap. The significant
    parameter is <em>pd</em>, the product of the gap distance and the pressure. Typically, the
    Townsend mechanism (and by extension Paschen's law) apply at <em>pd</em> products less
    than 1000 torr cm, or gaps around a centimeter at one atmosphere. Furthermore,
    some modifications are necessary for highly electronegative gases because they
    recombine the secondary electrons very quickly.</p>
<p>In general, an equation for breakdown is derived, and suitable parameters chosen
    by fitting to empirical data.</p>
<p>Here are three equations:</p>
<p>Breakdown voltage:<br>
    <tt>Vbreakdown = B * p * d / (C + ln( p * d))</tt></p>
<p>Breakdown field strength:<br>
    <tt>Ebreakdown = p * ( B / ( C + ln ( p * d)))</tt></p>
<p>where:<br>
    <tt>C =ln( A / ln ( 1 + 1 / gamma))</tt></p>
<p>where:<br>
    <tt>gamma</tt> is the (poorly known) secondary ionization coefficient.</p>
<p>For air:<br>
    <tt>A = 15 cm</tt><sup><tt>-1</tt></sup><tt>Torr </tt><sup><tt>-1</tt></sup><br>
    <tt>B = 365 Vcm</tt><sup><tt>-1</tt></sup><tt> Torr</tt><sup><tt>-1<br>
    </tt></sup>and <tt>gamma = 10</tt><sup><tt>-2</tt></sup><br>
    so<br>
    <tt>C = 1.18</tt></p>

<p>Note that the sparking voltage is affected by the electrode material, with
    cathodes of Barium and Magnesium having higher voltages than Aluminum, for example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Temperature dependence</h4>
<p>Paschen's law ( V = f(pd)) should really be stated as V = f( Nd) where N is
    the density of gas molecules, which is, of course, affected by the temperature
    as well as the pressure of the gas ( n/V = p/RT). An empirical formula for air
    (considering it as an ideal gas) is:</p>
<p><tt>x = 293 * p * d / (760 * T)<br>
    Vbreakdown = 24.22 * x + 6.08 * SQRT(x)<br>
</tt></p>
<p><tt>p = pressure in Torr (mm Hg),<br>
    d = distance in cm,<br>
    T = Temperature in Kelvins<br>
    Vbreakdown in kV</tt></p>
<h4>Humidity dependence</h4>
<p>In air, increasing humidity increases the breakdown voltage. The effect is
    most noticeable in uniform field, and less important in nonuniform gaps (such
    as sphere gaps where the gap is a large fraction of the sphere diameter, or
    in rod or needle gaps). An emprical expression for this is:</p>
<p>(not here yet)</p>
<h4>Gamma - Townsend's secondary ionization coefficient</h4>
<p>Gamma is the net (!) number of secondary electrons produced per incident
    positive ion, photon, excited or metastable particle. It is a function of gas pressure
    and E/p. Electronegative gases (SF6, Freon, oxygen, CO2) reattach the electrons
    very quickly, so they have low gammas. </p>
<p>For nitrogen, gamma ranges between 10-3 and 10-2 for E/p of 100-700 V cm-1
    torr-1. Insulating gases like SF6 or Freon have gammas of 10-4 or even less.</p>
