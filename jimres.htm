<p>James Lux <br>
    2857 Silk Oak Ave<br>
    Thousand Oaks CA 91362<br>

<p>James Lux brings a multidisciplinary approach to a wide variety of projects.
    He has developed, or managed the development of, systems and applications in
    several industries, so he is familiar with the fact that each industry has its
    own unique requirements. In addition, he has significant hardware design and
    development experience as well, including a 250 MHz bandwidth arbitrary waveform
    generator, a 2-18 GHz wideband instantaneous spectrum analyzer, and a unattended
    calibration station for monitoring an orbiting radar. He has worked with Hollywood
    special effects companies producing such spectacular effects as a 40 foot man-made
    tornado and a computer controlled rack of 96 cameras to track a 100 mph tennis
    ball. He has over 20 years of software development experience, ranging from
    FORTRAN simulations on IBM 1130's to fault tolerant file systems on multiprocessor
    architectures, to DSP for radar signal processing, to developing multimedia
    products.</p>

<p>His wide background means that his &quot;start-up&quot; time
    on a new project is minimal. Extensive experience with both
    hardware and software makes him a good team leader for projects
    where hardware/software integration is critical: He can explain
    the hardware limitations and requirements to the software people,
    and the software limitations and requirements to the hardware
    people. This is especially important with many of today's systems
    which rely on a synergistic combination of hardware and software.
</p>

<p>Mr. Lux has good communications and presentation skills, and
    has been team leader for numerous proposal efforts and design
    reviews. He has been published in a wide variety of journals and
    periodicals, at all levels of reader sophistication, and is
    particularly adept at explaining complex technical information to
    an audience which doesn't have a technical background. </p>
