<H2>Jim Lux - Work Experience</H2>
<h4>November 1999 - Present<br>
    Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>
    Telecommunications Science and Engineering Division<br>
    Spacecraft Telecommunications Section<br>
    Senior Member of Engineering Staff</h4>
<p>Participation in design team which is developing system and instrument architectures
    for the Radar Electronics Assembly for AlphaScat, a next generation Ku-band
    scatterometer. Creating a functional decomposition of the instrument tied to
    requirements using tools such as Statemate and DOORS. Leading development of
    DSP algorithms for radar signal processing with Avionics Flight Software section.
    Site visits and reviews for flight hardware vendors. Maintaining project web
    page(s). Creating and reviewing procedures,schedules, and budgets for development,
    design and test of breadboard and prototype digital radar processors. </p>
<p>Development of novel concepts for Mars communications networks using components
    designed for commercial wireless products, such as wideband CDMA cellular phones.</p>
<p>Participation in review boards and committees.</p>
<h4>May 1998 - November 1999<br>
    Swales Aerospace, Inc.<br>
    Pasadena Office<br>
    Senior RF Engineer</h4>
<p>Support of several projects at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, including the
    development of an Seawinds/QuikSCAT Calibration Ground Station, assisting with
    the RF final assembly and testing of the Free-Flying Magnetometers for the Enstrophy
    Project, and the conceptual design of a next generation Ku band scatterometer.</p>
<ul>
    <li>QuikSCAT Seawinds Calibration Ground Station - An unattended automated system
        to monitor the performance of the Seawinds Scatterometer which is on a polar
        orbiting platform. It is essentially a highly accurate Ku-band receiver which
        estimates the transmitted power of the spacecraft to 0.1 dB and makes accurate
        time and frequency measurements of the pulses from the radar. Novel features
        include direct IF conversion to digital, DSP processing of the pulses for
        parameter estimation, and extensive internal calibration.
    </li>
    <li>Free-Flying Magnetometers - The 4 hockey puck sized (10 cm diam x 5 cm)
        units contained a 3 axis magnetometer, some digital logic, and an S-band telemetry
        transmitter. They were ejected from a sounding rocket which was fired into
        the aurora over Fairbanks, AK. The magnetic field data recovered was used
        to measure the current flowing in the aurora. The FFM represents the first
        of a new type of spacecraft which is much smaller than previous instruments,
        and is designed to fly in echelon to collect data over a larger volume or
        area.
    </li>
    <li>Alpha Scatterometer - A next generation scatterometer is being developed
        which will be significantly smaller and lighter than the Seawinds instrument.
        The new instrument will advance the technology, both in packaging and in performance.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>February 1990 - Present<BR>
    Innovation Consulting &amp; Design</h4>
<P>Innovation Consulting &amp; Design (ICAD) is a small consulting firm which does short term contract hardware and software development, as well as project management services. Projects included: </P>
<h5>Hardware/software design &amp; control</h5>

        system of 100 cameras to track and photograph a tennis ball being served and
        returned. Included interface and tuning of hydraulic cylinder closed loop
        servo.
    </LI>
    <LI>Engineering analysis and design of machinery, aerodynamic simulation to
        create large (40 foot) artificial tornadoes. (See <A HREF="http://www.reelefx.com/">http://www.reelefx.com/</A>)
        Project manager of $300K project to build 15 foot permanent display tornado
        at Knotts Berry Farm. Design of electrical system for Knott's tornado, including
        programming of SLC500 series PLC and ABB variable speed drives. Preparation
        of patent applications.
    </LI>
    <LI>Development of a explosive ring vortex generator for producing concussion
        sound effects for live performances. An industrial PLC controls the flow of
        fuel and oxidizer into a combustion chamber and then triggers a spark to ignite
        the mixture. The amounts and timing of the gases and triggers are controlled
        by external show control interfaces (MIDI or DMX-512).
    </LI>
    <LI>Designed and constructed high voltage systems for exploding wires. A high
        voltage pulser vaporizes a several meter wire with a 10,000 amp pulse lasting
        about 10 microseconds. The discharge triggering can be synchronized to an
        external video signal or other source, to insure that the discharge occurs
        when the camera shutter is open. (See <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~jimlux/artlight.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~jimlux/artlight.htm</A>
        )
    </LI>
    <LI>Developed microwave video and data link for control and feedback between
        a "telepresence pod" and a "electric golf cart" camera platform. The system
        sends stereoscopic video and dynamics information back over a 5GHz band link
        to a virtual reality pod (essentially a 2 DOF motion base). Commands from
        the pod are transmitted back to the mobile platform.
    </LI>
    <LI>Implemented a system to numerically integrate matrix differential equations
        running as a screen saver on multiple network workstations, with the basic
        grid data maintained on a central network server. This was used to integrate
        the Navier-Stokes equations for simulation of man-made tornado airflow, and
        to integrate Laplace's equation to calculate electrostatic fields.
    </LI>
    <LI>Designed, wrote software and managed construction of a computer controlled
        motion base fan. Implemented closed loop control of stepper motors with analog
        position feedback to provide tilt and pan motions.
    </LI>
    <LI>Built and operated a computer controlled stepper drive for a 4 foot diameter
        stopwatch to be used in a television commercial. Computer control allowed
        flexible control of sweep second hand "ticks" including speed, direction,
        and distance to compensate for camera over or undercranking, as well as director's
        wishes for artistic effect.
    </LI>
    <LI>Designed and constructed proof of concept model for collision avoidance
        and optimal routing algorithms for an autonomous vehicle. Developed PWM motor

    </LI>
    <LI>Development of an information management system which keeps track of scanned
        images and paper documents for the South American Explorer's Club. It allows
        club staff to select documents by keyword, title, or other attributes, and
        then can produce printed copies of the documents (where scanned) or a duplication
        list (where hardcopy). Uses combination of MS Access, Visual Basic, and custom
        DLL's for image compression/decompression.
    </LI>
