<h2>Cloud Chambers</h2>
<p>Cloud chambers work by creating a supersaturated vapor in a chamber. Particles
    that pass through ionize the air, causing the vapor to condense along the track,
    forming &quot;rain&quot;. An external magnetic field (even that of the earth)
    cause the particles to curve.</p>
<p>There are two basic flavors: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Expansion - An inherently pulsed type, which create the saturated vapor
        by compressing it, then suddenly expanding it, forming a supersaturated enviroment.
    </li>
    <li>Diffusion - A continuous type, which relies on a (60-70C) temperature gradient
        in a chamber, often created by a slab of dry ice on the bottom, or some sort
        of mechanical refrigerator.
    </li>
</ul>

    This is a nice unit based on a surplus freezer which cools to around -10C, and
    resistance heaters to heat the working fluid. (note new URL, 3 Nov 2000)</p>
