<h2>Fusor Math</h2>
<p>First, a quote from R.W. Hamming: &quot;The purpose of computing is insight,
    not numbers.&quot; Use the math to get a feel for what is going on, but don't
    expect it to predict everything that will happen.</p>
<p>This page has descriptions and sample calculations for things of interest for
    fusorites:</p>

<p><a href="#detection">Detection Rates</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="rates"></a>Reaction Rates</h3>
<p>Nuclear reaction parameters are usually described in terms of their &quot;cross
    section&quot; (sigma, &sigma; ), given in barns (1E-24 cm2) (as in &quot;can't
    hit the broad side of a..&quot;). A barn is roughly the actual physical cross
    section of a typical nucleus, so, amusing name aside, it is of a scale that
    is useful. The cross section relates to a simple physical model of a beam of
    point particles (i.e. infinitely small) travelling through a field of targets,
    each with an area, perpendicular to the beam. (<a href="crosssectionanalogy.htm">An
        analogy</a> describing cross section) The event rate (or reaction rate) is simply</p>
<p>events / time = cross section * Intensity of beam * number density of targets</p>
<p>where the intensity of the beam is specified in terms o fthe number of particles
    per unit time crossing an area (A) that is the cross section of the beam (i.e.
    it is particles/second/area)</p>
<p>The number density of targets is the number of targets in a unit volume (for
    gases, this is easy, PV=nRT).</p>
<p>This equation gives you the number of collisions per unit time. Of course,
    not every collision results in some specified reaction, so you could add a probability
    to the equation, and get the real number of events:</p>
<p>events/time = probability * cross section * intensity * numberdensity</p>
<p>As it happens, the actual physical cross section of a nucleus isn't actually
    measureable (since it would require interacting with something, and that interaction
    would have a probability that is &lt;1, and quantum effects would bite you,
    etc.), so we use what you can measure (reaction rates), and calculate back to
    effective cross section (i.e. area), which folds in the probability and the
    physical cross section, as well as the relative sizes of target and projectile,
    etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A practical example</h3>
<p>Lets say we want to calculate the reaction rate of a beam of deuterons hitting
    a stationary target of deuterium gas. The beam current will be 1 mA, and it's
    cross sectional area will be 1 cm^2. The target is a cell of deuterium at 20degrees
    C at a pressure of 1E-3 torr that is 1 cm thick. Finally, lets assume that the
    deuteron beam has an energy of 50 keV.</p>
<h4>Step1: What is the beam intensity?</h4>
<p> We know the current: 1 mA, so we know how many deuterons per second are flowing
    in the beam: 6.24E15 /second (1 Amp = 1 Coulomb/second = 6.242E18 electrons/second).
    We've got the area of the beam as well (1 cm^2).</p>
<h4>Step 2: What is the target number density?</h4>
<p> Use PV=nRT, rearranged as n/V = P/RT.</p>
<p>R = 8314.3 J/(kmol K)</p>
<p>P = 0.133 Pascal (1 torr = 133 Pa)</p>
<p>T = 273+20 = 293K</p>
<p>n/V = 0.133/(8314.3 * 293) = 54.7E-6 mols/cubic meter = 54.7E-12 mols/cc</p>
<p>54.7E-12 * 6.022E23 atoms/mol = 3.29E13 atoms/cc</p>
<h4>Step 3: look up the cross section for the reaction of interest</h4>
<p>50 keV d(d,n) reaction.. 4.55E-3 barn (= 4.55E-27 sq cm)</p>
<p>Fusor reactions of interest can be found at <a href="sigma.htm" target="_blank">sigma.htm</a>
    (which will open a new window in the browser)</p>
<h4>Step 4: multiply it out...</h4>
<p>reaction rate = 4.55E-27 cm^2 * 6.24E15 /(cm^2*second) * 3.29E13 atoms/cc *
    1 cc (target vol)</p>
<p>= 934 reactions/second</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="detection"></a>Detection rates</h3>
<p>There are a LOT of factors that go into detection probabilities. There is first
    the geometric issue (the particles of interest may go in all directions, but
    your sensor only covers some), which can be influenced by the angular distribution
    of the particles. For instance, a beam of deuterons hitting a stationary deuterium
    target does NOT send all the neutrons off in a nice spherical distribution.
    And, depending on the particle, the ones that don't head right towards the detector
    might get scattered off something else and then wind up at the detector anyway.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a detector efficiency issue (i.e. the detector doesn't necessarily
    detect every particle). Depending on the detector, the sensitivity might vary
    with particle energy as well.</p>
<p>However for a first approximation, a simple calculation will suffice. Assume
    that the particles of interest are emerging from a point source, and evenly
    distributed over a sphere. Then, imagine a sphere at the radius of your detector.
    All you need to do is calculate the fraction of that sphere that your detector
    occupies:</p>
<p>Detection rate = reaction rate * (diameter of detector^2) / (16 * distance
    to detector^2)</p>
<h4>A sample calculation</h4>
<p>Assume a 2&quot; diameter BC-720 neutron scintillator, at 30 cm from the center
    of the reaction described in the previous example, which yields about 934 neutrons/second.</p>
<p>Calculating:</p>
<p>detection rate = 934 * 5.08^2 / (16 * 30^2) = 934 * 1.79E-3</p>
<p>= 1.67 potential detections/second.</p>
<p>In practice, the neutron detector might have an efficiency much less than 100%.
    Note also that if you move the detector closer, the rate gets higher faster:
    halving the distance will quadruple the detection rate. (Of course, moving it
    closer might also introduce noise and other artifacts)</p>
