  This is not an exhaustive discussion and tends to elaborate on some technical 
  points. A better introduction to alternate fuels is in the hot fusion FAQ. Thanks 
  to Robert Nachtrieb, Philip Benjamin Snyder, and John W. Cobb for thoughtful 
  comments and useful numbers. I can't offer much in the way of references, but 
  you might want to look at </p>

<p>If you want to use fusion as a source of energy, the reaction chosen must satisfy 
  several <br>
  criteria. It must: </p>
<ul>
  <li> be exothermic. This one is obvious, but it limits the reactants to the 
    low Z side of the curve of binding energy. It also makes helium He-4 the most 
    common product because of its extraordinarily tight binding, although He3 
    and T also show up.</li>
  <li> involve low Z nuclei. This is because the electrostatic repulsion must 
    be overcome before the nuclei are close enough to fuse.</li>
  <li> have two reactants. At anything less than stellar densities, three body 
    collisions are too improbable.</li>
  <li> have two or more products. This allows simultaneous conservation of energy 
    and momentum without relying on the (weak!) electromagnetic force. </li>
  <li> and conserve both protons and neutrons. The cross sections for the weak 
    interaction are too small.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This makes the list of candidates pretty short. The most interesting reactions 
  are the following. <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><tt> D +T -> He4 (3.5 MeV) + n (14.1 MeV)</tt></li>
  <li><tt> D +D -> T (1.01 MeV) + p ( 3.02 MeV) (50%) </tt></li>
  <li><tt>D +D -> He3 (0.82 MeV) + n ( 2.45 MeV) (50%)</tt></li>
  <li><tt> D +He3 -> He4 (3.6 MeV) + p (14.7 MeV) </tt></li>
  <li><tt>T +T -> He4 + 2 n + 11.3 MeV </tt></li>
  <li><tt>He3+He3 -> He4 + 2 p</tt></li>
  <li><tt> He3+T -> He4 + p + n + 12.1 MeV (51%)</tt></li>
  <li><tt>He3+T -> He4 (4.8 MeV) + D ( 9.5 MeV) (43%)</tt></li>
  <li><tt> He3+T -> He4 (0.5 MeV) + n ( 1.9 MeV) + p (11.9 MeV) (6%)</tt></li>
  <li><tt> D +Li6 -> 2 He4 + 22.4 MeV (11) p +Li6 -> He4 (1.7 MeV) + He3 ( 2.3 
    MeV)</tt></li>
  <li><tt> He3+Li6 -> 2 He4 + p + 16.9 MeV</tt></li>
  <li><tt> p +B11 -> 3 He4 + 8.7 MeV</tt></li>
</ol>
<p><br>
  The cross section, sigma, generally rises dramatically with temperature up to 
  a maximum. A fusion reactor (not only a tokamak) will be limited in the pressure 
  attainable. The fusion power density, which can be considered a rough surrogate 
  for the cost of power, is proportional to /T^2, where < > denotes an average 
  over a Maxwellian distribution. For any given fuel, you will usually want to 
  operate at the temperature where this function is maximum. </p>
<p>As a side note, one way to try to get around the limitations I will discuss 
  below is to consider a non-Maxwellian plasma. The migma is one example of a 
  concept which claims to work better with fuels other than D-T because the plasma 
  is not Maxwellian. Another elegant idea is to combine the reactions (11) and 
  (12). The He3 from reaction (11) can react with Li6 in reaction (12) before 
  completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton which in turn undergoes 
  reaction (11) before thermalizing. The last I heard is that this won't really 
  work, but it is a good example of a case where the assumption of a Maxwellian 
  plasma in not appropriate. </p>
<p> It is also important to remember that the reactions above never occur in their 
  pure form. This is obvious in the case of reactions (2) and (3), which occur 
  equally often in a deuterium plasma. Thus the aneutronic nature of (2) is spoiled 
  by the neutron from (3). Furthermore, the T produced by reaction (2) has a good 
  chance of reacting with a D in the background plasma to produce a neutron, and 
  an energetic one at that.
</p>
<p>
  Or take p-B11, which appears to be completely aneutronic. Although the neutron 
  production rate would be perhaps two to four orders of magnitude smaller than 
  for D-T, there are still a number of side reactions that will produce neutrons, 
  e.g., </p>
<p> p + B11 -> C12 + gamma <br>
  p + B11 -> n +C11 <br>
  He4 + B11 -> n + N14 <br>
  He4 + B11 -> p + C14 <br>
  He4 + B11 -> T + C12 <br>
  B11 + B11 -> junk </p>
<p> as well as reactions with a possible B10 impurity fraction. Furthermore, some 
  of the energetic product alphas will impinge on the wall and knock out neutrons. 
</p>
<p>Back to /T^2, the maximum values for some of these reactions is given here, 
  with T in keV and in (m^3/sec/keV^2). </p>
<pre>     fuel T(keV) /T^2 
     ---- ------ ------------- 
     DT 13.6 1.24e-24 
     DD 15 1.28e-26 
     DHe3 58 2.24e-26 
     pLi6 66 1.46e-27 
     pB11 123 3.01e-27 </pre>
 

<p>Li6 is primarily interesting for the potential chain reaction mentioned above. 
  Since the calculations below assume a Maxwellian distribution, and the /T^2 
  for p-Li6 is somewhat worse than for p-B11, we will only consider the latter 
  from here on out. That leaves us with four reactions with varying degrees of 
  neutron problems and varying performance. Let us use the these cross sections 
  to calculate two figures of merit for a reaction, the minimum n*T*tau which 
  allow ignition and the fusion power density. </p>
<p>Consider any fusion reaction (except D-D!) between a hydrogen species (subscript 
  1) and another species with atomic number Z (subscript Z), where Z may equal 
  to 1. The electron density is given by quasineutrality: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>n_e = n_1 + Z*n_Z </tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming all species have the same temperature T, the total pressure is </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>p = (n_e+n_1+n_Z)*T</tt> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Therefore, for a given pressure the maximum value of n_1*n_Z is </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <tt>(n_1*n_Z)_max = (1/16)*(p/T)^2*(2/(Z+1))</tt> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus there is a "penalty" of (2/(Z+1)) for non-hydrogenic fuels, which I included 
  in my table. The D-D reaction(s) must be calculated differently. First, there 
  is only one species of ion, so</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <tt>n_e = n_D <br>
    p = (n_e+n_D)*T </tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reaction rate is n_D^2/2, not n_D^2. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>(n_D^2/2)_max = (1/16)*(p/T)^2*2 </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Thus D-D gets a "bonus" of 2 because each ion can react with every other ion, 
  not just half of the others. The D-D reaction has of course two pathways which 
  are equally probable, so we have to take the average of the two. It is not clear 
  what should be assumed about the product T and He3. T burns so well in a deuterium 
  plasma that you probably can't get it out even if you want to. The D-He3 reaction 
  is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at the optimum D-D 
  temperature may be low, so let's assume the T but not the He3 gets burned up 
  and adds its energy to the net reaction. Thus I count the DD fusion energy as 
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>E_fusion = (4.03+17.6+3.27)/2 = 12.5 MeV </tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the energy in charged particles as </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>E_charged = (4.03+3.5+0.82)/2 = 4.2 MeV </tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With these assumptions and the /T^2 maximum values, we find a relative reactivity 
  of </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><tt>     fuel penalty/bonus /T^2     ratio 
     ---- ------------- -------- ----- 
     DT        1        1.24e-24 1 
     DDn+DDp   2        1.28e-26 48 
     DHe3      2/3      2.24e-26 83 
     pB11      1/3      3.01e-27 1240 </tt></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>For the relative Lawson values, we need to weight with the energy of the charged 
  particles: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>     fuel E_charged Lawson/Lawson_DT 
     ---- --------- ---------------- 
     DT 3.5 1 
     DDn+DDp 4.2 30 
     DHe3 18.3 16 
     pB11 8.7 500</pre>
  <br>
  For the relative power densities, we need to weight with the total fusion energy: 
  <br>
  <pre>     fuel E_fusion P_DT/P 
     ---- --------- ------ 
     DT 17.6 1 
     DDn+DDp 12.5 68 
     DHe3 18.3 80 
     pB11 8.7 2500 
     </pre>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
  The comparison between DD and DHe3 is complicated by several factors. One is 
  the assumption of zero product He3 burnup for the DD reaction as mentioned above. 
  Another is that a DHe3 plasma will produce a lot of DD side reactions. Fuel 
  availability is an issue for DHe3 but not for DD. Since the results are within 
  a figure of two of each other and one or two orders of magnitude worse than 
  DT, we don't need to look at them any closer for present purposes. </p>
<p> The dependence of confinement time on ion mass might improve the pB11 numbers 
  by a factor of two.</p>
<p> The Lawson ratios tell you how much better tau_E has to be to get a given 
  reaction going. Using the empirically determined scaling of tau_E in tokamaks, 
  it can be shown, if magnetic field and safety factor are held constant, that 
  the volume scales very nearly linearly with the inverse of/T^3. (See ``Reactor 
  size scaling'') If the ordering of /T^3 is similar to that of /T^2, and the 
  cost of a device scales somewhat more slowly than the plasma volume, say with 
  the volume to the 2/3 power, then the relative cost for a machine which burns 
  an alternate fuel is the Lawson ratio to the 2/3 power. For example, if a DT 
  breakeven experiment costs 10 billion dollars, then a breakeven DHe3 experiment 
  might cost 60 billion dollars. At the same time, the fusion output of the DHe3 
  device will be about five times lower than the other (16 times the volume but 
  81 times worse reactivity). </p>
<p> This argument is admittedly very primitive, but it shows the magnitude of 
  the disadvantage that has to be overcome by the advantages of a fuel which produces 
  fewer neutrons. I have not looked at them myself, but apparently the ARIES III 
  and Apollo reactor studies conclude the the cost of electricity from a DHe3 
  reactor would be comparable to or lower than that from a DT reactor. They gain 
  some because the blanket does not have to breed tritium and does not have to 
  absorb as large a fraction of the fusion energy, so it can be smaller. But it 
  still has to be thick enough to absorb 14 MeV neutrons. They gain further by 
  assuming a higher magnetic field and a higher plasma current. But it is not 
  fair to compare a low field DT machine with a high field DHe3 machine. It is 
  true that tritium containment and handling systems are no longer needed, but 
  I don't believe they drive the cost of a power plant. If the plasma energy can 
  be coupled out directly, e.g. through synchrotron radiation, then DHe3 will 
  have a higher conversion efficiency and less down time to change out neutron 
  damaged parts. This advantage may be more decisive at high fields and high betas. 
  It cannot be ruled out that a DHe3 reactor will ultimately be more economical 
  than a DT reactor, but it will require many developments, and even then it may 
  be a toss-up. </p>
<p> Other points of comparison are safety and conversion efficiency. D-He3 does 
  indeed have weighty safety advantages over D-T. (Of course, if it isn't able 
  to ignite at all it is even safer.) D-He3 has the potential for a more efficient 
  fusion to electricity conversion. Whether this potential can be utilized and 
  whether the increased efficiency will pay for the increased capital cost are 
  speculative. We should also keep in mind that T and He3 do not exist on earth 
  in significant quantities; T must be breed from Li and He3 must be accumulated 
  from the decay of T or mined in space.</p>
<p>Everyone is entitled to an opinion on the ultimately optimum fuel cycle, but 
  only future generations will really have the knowledge base to make a choice. 
</p>
<p>Fuels other than DT and DD must also run at significantly higher temperatures. 
  This increases the cyclotron radiation losses dramatically and possibly fatally. 
  For this reason, some arguments for alternate fuels invoke high beta machines, 
  usually other than tokamaks. It is sometimes also argued that a particular concept, 
  which is believed to have inherently better confinement than the tokamak, cannot 
  be used with DT because the neutron flux at the first wall would be too large. 
  Because of its special configuration, The FRC may also be able to use the 14 
  MeV protons as an intrinsic current drive. A portion of the protons moving in 
  one direction may be trapped in the FRC while those moving oppositely are not. 
  Thus selective trapping can lead to self-generated currents from the fusion 
  products. Berk, Momota, and Tajima estimated that about 25% of the total current 
  drive can be obtained this way. The same effect does occur with the 4 MeV alphas 
  in a DT tokamak. However, the alpha energy is lower, its mass larger, and the 
  number of rho_i in the device is larger so the trapping area in phase space 
  is smaller and the generated current is smaller. Even though there is serious 
  discussion of whether the advantages of D-He3 might make up for the one to two 
  orders of magnitude disadvantages in the long run for a test reactor that is 
  certainly not the case. </p>
