<h3>Comparisons between Leatherman and Gerber Multi-Tool</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Gerber MultiTool has blunt ended pliers which are useless for removing
        cactus spines and the like. The Leatherman has really good needle nose
        pliers, which can reach into small areas, hold small objects (like those cactus
        spines), etc.
    </li>
    <li>I haven't ever seen anyone break a Leatherman, and I have seen people
        break the Gerber tools, and I have seen both used pretty hard.
    </li>
    <li>The Gerber uses non-stainless steel bolts to hold it together, and they rust!</li>
</ul>
