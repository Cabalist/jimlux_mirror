<p>11 July 1991 - Shadow images of the crescent sun</p>
<p>This was a really peculiar effect. The asymmetrical shape of the sun made shadows appear to have
    a fuzzy edge, particularly around sharp objects (like your fingers). Normally, a shadow cast by the
    sun has a dark core (umbra) and a slightly lighter outer part (penumbra), but because it is very
    uniform, and due to the eye/brain perception, you see it as a very sharp line. This is decidedly not
    the case here. I had heard about this, but it is far more striking in person. </p>

        <td style="width: 50%">This is a shadow of my hand making a small hole
            between my fingers and palm. Note the distinct
            crescent image in the middle as well as less
            distinct ones by my finger tips.
