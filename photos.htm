<title>Jim's Photo Portfolio</title>
<body>
<p>These photos were quickly scanned from 8x10 original prints as TIFF files.
    They were converted to JPEG using Adobe Photoshop at "medium" resolution,
    so the color isn't great, and neither is the resolution,
    but then, you'd have to see the original image to do it justice.</p>
<p>Click on one of the thumbnail photos to the left to see a bigger version
    (typically 5 inches on the long dimension at 75
    pixels/inch). The big versions are all about 10-20Kbytes, so they should download in
    about 10 seconds.</p>

<p>All of these photos are copyright James Lux with all rights reserved, so don't go
    making copies of them without getting my written permission first! You can link to them,
    providing you give me credit.</p>
