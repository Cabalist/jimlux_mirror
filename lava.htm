<h2>Making Lava at Home</h2>
<p>My daughter Samantha, who is fascinated by lava, asked if it was possible to
    make lava at home (or in the lab). Since lava is essentially molten rock, I
    figured it should be possible, given a suitable furnace. If you can melt metal,
    you should be able to melt rocks, assuming the temperatures are reasonable.</p>
<h4>How hot is lava?</h4>
<p>First, you can go by color. Lava is orange yellow, which implies a temperature
    around 1000C, just on the correlation between color and temperature. A little
    research on the web turned up a very useful site: Volcano World (<a href="http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vw.html">http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vw.html</a>),
    particularly &quot;ask a volcanologist&quot;, which has been discontinued, but
    the info is in the FAQ's. We turned up the following useful data. The conversions
    are approximate</p>
<table style="width:64%;border:1px">
    <tr>
        <th>Rock type</th>
        <th>Temperature (C)</th>
        <th>Temperature (F)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rhyolite</td>
        <td>700-900</td>
        <td>1300-1700</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dacite</td>
        <td>800-1100</td>
        <td>1500-2000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Andesite</td>
        <td>950-1200</td>
        <td>1750-2200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Basalt</td>
        <td>1000-1250</td>
        <td>1850-2300</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p> Note that the lighter the color of the rock, the lower the melting point.
    More generally, lava is typically between 900 and 1200C (1600F to 2200F).. say
    about the temperature of molten iron (1200C) , but not as hot as steel (1400C)...
    but a lot hotter than brass (600C) or aluminum (658C).</p>
<p>And, just as a guideline, glass is essentially molten silica, which is rock,
    so, if you can melt glass, you can melt rock.</p>
<p>In terms of absolute energy required to melt a kg of rock, I approximated it
    by using sulfur (38 kJ/kg) for the heat of fusion, and assuming the specific
    heat is that of glass (.84 kJ/kg K). Heat to 1000C requires 840 kJ, and melting
    requires another 40, so you need to put about 900 kJ into that kilo of rock
    to melt it.</p>
<h3>The furnace</h3>
<p>Since I had other projects for which I wanted a furnace, I decided to make
    a sort of generic crucible furnace. I've always wanted to try casting metal,
    <a href="http://imr.chem.binghamton.edu/labs/super/superc.html">making high
        temperature superconductors</a> (you need a furnace that goes to 1000C) , and
    a variety of other high temperature projects. The choice is between gas fired
    and electric fired. Certainly, electrically operated furnaces are cleaner and
    quieter, but, there is something satisfying about a big gas burner roaring away.
    And, gas fired furnaces are cheaper to operate (not that I expect to spend anything
    more than a nominal amount on either approach). Finally, I figured it would
    be easier to get a lot of heat quickly with a gas burner (I hate waiting, and
    it's easy to get 50-100 kW out of a gas flame (propane is 46 MJ/kg, and a standard
    5 gal/20lb propane tank (like for a barbecue) will burn for quite a while at
    that rate (about 5-10 lb/hr))</p>
<p>Mind you, a lot of the heat goes into heating up the furnace, the air, and
    so forth, otherwise it would only take 10 seconds to pump 900 kJ out. </p>
<p>If you go electric, and figure that 2.5 kW is about the maximum electrical
    power you want to put in (=20 Amps on a 240 V service), it will take a bit longer
    to put the heat in (375 seconds or just over 6 minutes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The burner</h4>
<p>I built a pair of propane burners based on the forge burner designs on Ron
    Reil's page: <a href="http://www.reil1.net/design1.shtml">http://www.reil1.net/design1.shtml
    </a>specifically, the EZ burner, which has a minimum of machining, and is made
    from a bunch of standard black iron plumbing fittings. I made the burner using
    3/4&quot; pipe. </p>
<p>My initial test was running the burner at 20 psi through a #57 orifice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The refractory material</h4>
<p>For my first lash-up (which may actually be the last), I bought a couple dozen
    firebricks (at $0.98/each) from Carlson Building Materials. They get their firebricks
    from Pacific Clay ( <a href="http://www.pacificclay.com/" target="_blank">http://www.pacificclay.com/</a>
    ) in Lake Elsinore, California. I called Pacific Clay to find out the specs,
    and they sent me a fax saying that they aren't real refractory bricks, but that
    they should work to 2300F.</p>
<p>Companies like BNZ Materials (<a href="http://www.bnzmaterials.com/" target="_blank">http://www.bnzmaterials.com/</a>)
    make the real thing, with bricks at various temperature ratings from 2300 up
    to 3000F. This assumes the traditional furnace approach with refractory bricks
    with relatively low thermal conductivity, but still quite massive. You wind
    up heating the bricks mostly. A potentially better approach is to use high temperature
    ceramic fiber insulators like Kaowool from Thermal Ceramics (<a href="http://www.thermalceramics.com/" target="_blank">http://www.thermalceramics.com/</a>
    ) and various insulating/reflective/refractory coatings from International Technical
    Ceramics (<a href="http://users.southeast.net/%7Eitc/" target="_blank">http://users.southeast.net/~itc/</a>)
    which gives you much better thermal insulation, requiring less total heat input
    to get the oven up to temperature. Of course, if you aren't energy cost constrained,
    then the traditional approach probably works as well.</p>
