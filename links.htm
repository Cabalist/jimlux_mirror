<h4><a name="General">General</a></h4>
<p><a href="http://www.reelefx.com/">Reel EFX, Inc.</a> - The physical special effects company I do a lot of work for. Check out their 
tornadoes, which I have had more than a little to do with.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.samexplo.org/">South American Explorer's Club</a> - a useful resource if you plan on travelling to South or Central 
America.</p>
<p>InterNIC whois service: <a href="http://ds2.internic.net/wp/nwhois.html">http://ds2.internic.net/wp/nwhois.html</a> - how you find someone's domain, 
look up who controls a domain, or turn a dotted address into a name.</p>
<p>Amateur Callsign lookup page: <a href="http://www.ualr.edu/~hamradio/callsign.html">http://www.ualr.edu/~hamradio/callsign.html</a></p>
<p>Conejo Valley Amateur Radio Club: <a href="http://www.cvarc.org/">http://www.cvarc.org/</a></p>
<p>Bill Beatty's Tesla Page - Has a lot of information, as well as a lot of links to other pages. 
<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~billb/tesla">http://www.eskimo.com/~billb/tesla</a></p>
<p>Brian Webb's Vandenberg AFB Launch Schedule - Find out when the next rocket launch is, etc: 
<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/rawhide_home_page/">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/rawhide_home_page/</a>&#160;</p>

<h4><a name="Weather">Weather related</a></h4>
<p>Online NEXRAD (WSR-88) image for Los Angeles:
 <a href="http://www.intellicast.com/LocalWeather/World/UnitedStates/Southwest/California/LosAngeles/BaseReflectivity/">
http://www.intellicast.com/LocalWeather/World/UnitedStates/Southwest/California/LosAngeles/BaseReflectivity/</a>. 
  From there you can navigate around and find the southern California composite, 
  or the NEXRAD maps for Santa Ana and San Diego. These are just reflectivity 
  maps. If anyone finds a source for live doppler data on the web (or ftp), <a href="mailto:jimlux@earthlink.net">let 
  me know</a></p>
<p>Los Angeles NWS office: <a href="http://www.nwsla.noaa.gov/">http://www.nwsla.noaa.gov/</a>. They've got now casts (i.e. what the 
weather is doing now and will be doing for the next 6 or so hours), forecasts out into the future, as 
well as links to all kinds of stuff weather related.</p>
<p>The tornado project: <a href="http://www.tornadoproject.com/">http://www.tornadoproject.com/</a> - lots of useful stuff about tornadoes, as well 
as many links to other tornado related sites. By the way, <em>Tornado Video Classics</em>, vols I,II, and 
III are the best tornado tapes around.</p>
<p>USGS Pasadena Office <a href="http://www-socal.wr.usgs.gov/">http://www-socal.wr.usgs.gov/</a> 
  - they have a really nifty realtime earthquake analysis display. <a href="http://www.scecdc.scec.org/recenteqs/">http://www.scecdc.scec.org/recenteqs/</a> 
  is the recent southern California Earthquake page.</p>
<h4>Solar Weather and Aurora</h4>
<p>Sunspots and the sunspot cycle: <a href="http://www.sunspotcycle.com/">http://www.sunspotcycle.com/</a><br>
  Space weather, specifically, real time aurora displays: <a href="http://www.spacew.com/www/auroral.html">http://www.spacew.com/www/auroral.html</a></p>

<h4><a name="Physics ">Physics </a>Info &amp; other interesting sites</h4>
<p>Make your own High Temperature Superconductors (YBCO). All you need is an oven capable of 
1000 degrees Celsius, a little Barium Pentoxide, Cupric Oxide and Yittrium Oxide, and &quot;Bob's 
your uncle&quot;. <a href="http://imr.chem.binghamton.edu/labs/super/superc.html">http://imr.chem.binghamton.edu/labs/super/superc.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/shansen/belljar/">the Bell Jar</a>&quot; - a worthy successor to C.L. Stong's &quot;Amateur Scientist&quot; column in Scientific 
American.</p>
<p>Society for Amateur Scientists - <a href="http://web2.thesphere.com/SAS/">http://web2.thesphere.com/SAS/</a></p>
<p>Carey Sublette's Nuclear Weapons FAQ - a very readable summary of various aspects of nuclear 
weapons design and proliferation. It has a fair amount of detail including useful equations, not only 
for weapons design, but also for blast effects, which is what I was looking for:	
<a href="http://www.envirolink.org/issues/nuketesting/hew/">http://www.envirolink.org/issues/nuketesting/hew/</a></p>
<p>A link to an article in US News &amp; World Reports about some exotic weapons, some of which I 
have worked on <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/970707/7WEIR.HTM">http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/970707/7WEIR.HTM</a></p>
<h4><a name="Legal">Legal</a> and patent stuff</h4>
<p>IBM Patent Server <a href="http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/">http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/</a> - Has all the patents since 1971 with text 
search capability. You can print the patent from here, but it is really ugly, spread across multiple 
printer pages, etc. Clearly they are trying to encourage you to buy the patent copy in the usual way 
for a few bucks (which by the way, is a good deal from the PTO at $3 a copy). At least the 
abstract and first drawing print out ok, and the search engine works great.</p>
<p>Legal Information Institute: <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/">http://www.law.cornell.edu/</a> - Almost all of the US Code (i.e. Federal 
laws, but not regulations).</p>
<p>All the OSHA regulations: <a href="http://www.osha-slc.gov/">http://www.osha-slc.gov/</a> - Debunk those people who claim that OSHA 
requires you to do something. Lots of times, they don't. Find out the real rules, and also lots of 
correspondence and opinion letters interpreting the rules.</p>
