<h2>Robot Solar Power</h2>
<p>Doing some research at Arizona Wind and Sun... (http://www.windsun.com/) on
    6 Jan 2002</p>
<p>Looks like generally, $5/watt for the usual panels. The flex panels from Solarex
    are as low as $4.39/watt, but the Unisolar ones are $12/watt. Output is around
    120 W/square meter for the fixed panels, 47W/square meter for the flex panels
    (a heck of a lot less efficient!)</p>
<p>The real problem seems to be that the bigger panels (75W plus), are all 1.2
    meters long or bigger. No problem when bolting it to your roof, a big problem
    on a 1 meter long rover.... </p>
<p>I wonder if you can redesign the panels a bit.....</p>

<p>Individual Cells</p>
<p>Astropower (http://www.astropower.com/) has a eval kit for $185 that has 20
    AP105 cells (5&quot; single crystal, 2.1 W) which is: 40W, or about $4.60/watt
    (pretty high, considering you can get a whole panel already assembled for about
    the same..)</p>
<p>The Solar Cell Company (http://www.solarcell.net/) sells 4&quot; cells, 0.9W
    for $1.95, or 36/$64.75 (which is about $2/Watt). Kind of a cheesy web site,
    but heck, they're in the business of selling solar cells, not web design. (114W/square
    meter of cell area) </p>
<p>http://www.solarbotics.net/library/pieces/parts_elect_semic_solar.html has
    some interesting analysis and a handy calculator showing that All Electronics
    cells SPL-22, which are 10 for $5 are not such a bad deal. 20mm square, .45Voc
    100mA Isc (the catalog shows V@I (simultaneous), but hah, we know better). ANyway,
    they're up in the big 0.12 mW/mm2 clump (120W/m2..), and give 90mW/$. Interestingly,
    this is $10/W... The SolarCell company selling the $2/0.9W cells is a much better
    deal on a W/$ basis, </p>
<p>Reflectors</p>
<p>There's a fair amount of literature on the web about using a concentrator with
    a cell. Even a flat plate mirror can increase the output (never as much as the
    whole area), especially when you have a fixed orientation panel. And, mirrors
    are a heck of a lot cheaper than cells.</p>
