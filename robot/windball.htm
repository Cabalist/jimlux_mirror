<h2>Wind Force on Balls </h2>
<p>When contemplating spherical robots that might operate outdoors, the force
    of the wind blowing on the ball is of interest. A detailed calculation would
    be quite complex, because of the interaction of the ground surface. However,
    for estimation purposes, we can probably bound the force.</p>

<h3>First order approach</h3>
<p>A simple approach is to consider the force as the aerodynamic drag on a sphere
    acting at the center of the sphere. The drag of a sphere is actually somewhat
    complex for low speed flow because of boundary layer issues (why golf balls
    have dimples, for instance). Some web references are : http://aerodyn.org/Drag/speed-drag.html#sphere
    or http://www.princeton.edu/~asmits/Bicycle_web/blunt.html. We can assume as
    a sort of worst case that Cd=1.0 (typical for a sphere at lowish Reynolds numbers
    (ca. 100)).</p>
<p>Drag = rho * Cd * v^2 * Area </p>
<p>where</p>
<p>rho = density of air <br>
    v = velocity<br>
    Area = flat plate projected area = pi*r^2 for a sphere</p>
<p>In practice, the equation is rendered as K*v^2*r^2, where the constant K absorbs:
    air density, unit conversion factors, and pi</p>
<p>For v in m/sec, r in meters, and drag in Newtons, K = 1.184 kg/m^3 * 3.14159
    = 3.71964</p>
<p>For v in mi/hr, r in feet, and drag in pounds, K = K(SI units) * .447 m/sec/(mi/hr)
    * 1/3.28^2 (m^2/ft^2) * 1/4.54 pounds/newton = 3.40E-2 (or approximately 1/29.4)</p>
<p>Some typical numbers for a 1 meter diameter sphere are given in the following
    table. Consider that the thing we are really concerned about is the moment which
    is trying to turn the sphere, so one should really divide these numbers by 2,
    to get the moment in Nmeter. The table shows the mass that would have to be
    at the upwind point of the sphere to resist this moment. Clearly, one can't
    put all the mass there, so one would need more mass, with the CG somewhat inside
    the shell.</p>

<h3>Second order approach</h3>
<p>A very handy reference by Blevins (<i>Applied Fluid Dynamics Handbook, </i>Krieger
    Publishing Company, Malabar, Florida, 1992<i> </i>) gives some approximations
    for Cd and Cl of a cylinder near a wall (p318) at Re= 20,000. No mention is
    made if the incident flow is laminar or turbulent. Blevins is citing Roshko,
    A., <i>et al.</i>, &quot;Flow Forces on a Cylinder Near a Wall or Near Another
    Cylinder,&quot; Second National Conference on Wind Engineering Research, Colorado
    State University, Ft. Collins, Colorado, June, 1975.</p>

        <td>0.8</td>

    <tr>
        <td>0.5</td>
        <td>1.2</td>
        <td>0.15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1.0</td>
        <td>1.3</td>
        <td>0.05</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1.5</td>
        <td>1.2</td>
        <td>0.02</td>

    <tr>
        <td>2.0</td>
        <td>1.2</td>
        <td>0</td>

        <td>4.0</td>

    <tr>
        <td>6.0</td>
        <td>1.2</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>The table on page 335 in Blevins gives some numbers for a cube above a surface,
    and while there is a net downforce (i.e. Cl is negative), the Cd numbers appear
    reasonably similar. The Cd numbers appear to be of the same general magnitude
    as used in the first order computation.</p>
