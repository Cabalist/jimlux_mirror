<h2>Locomotion alternatives</h2>
<p>Looking at generalized the generalized <a href="robotreqs.htm">requirements</a>
    (and my budget), I've identified 4 basic approaches, all with wheels. Although..
    perhaps legs are in fact practical. Take a look at RHex, and my ideas for a
    <a href="bug.htm">bug</a>. </p>
<h3>6 wheel rocker-bogie Mars Rover type</h3>
<p>The Mars Rover has a passive suspension system using what's called a rocker
    bogie. There are 6 wheels, 3 on a side, connected with pivots and a differential
    gear (so the &quot;body&quot; is always at half the angle between the two sides).
    The wheels are roughly evenly spaced about twice the wheel diameter apart (at
    228 and 254 mm on MPF, with 130 mm wheels). The front and back wheels are steerable.
    It can go over an obstacle 1.5 times the wheel diameter (30 cm for the 20 cm
    wheels on the MER2003 rover). A lot of the JPL design is determined by the need
    to fit it on a spacecraft, and to be reliably deployed on landing.</p>
<p><a href="http://fido.jpl.nasa.gov/">http://fido.jpl.nasa.gov/</a> has information on FIDO, which is sort of a prototype
    for MER.<br>
    <a href="http://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/groups/rv/">http://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/groups/rv/</a> has pictures of various JPL rovers,
    most showing Don Bickler's &quot;Rocker Bogie&quot; suspension</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6 wheel SHRIMP rover</h3>
<p>This design from Switzerland (<a href="http://www.bluebotics.com/">http://www.bluebotics.com/</a>
    is the commercial outlet) arranges the wheels in a rhombus, that is 1 front
    wheel, two pairs of middle wheels, then 1 trailing wheel. The two middle wheels
    on each side are connected with links, and the front wheel has a 4 link suspension
    with a spring. There isn't any connection between the two sides (like there
    is in the JPL rover). Just the front and back wheels steer. The inventors claim
    obstacle climbing of 2 times the wheel diameter (there are videos showing it).
    For a given size wheel (assuming everything scales), the SHRIMP is a bit longer
    than the JPL rover, and the center payload area appears smaller. The SHRIMP
    inventors point out that the suspension is entirely passive, and doesn't require
    active intervention to handle the terrain. (this is also true of the JPL rovers,
    and the NOMAD)</p>
<p>A significant flaw in Shrimp (and in the JPL rovers) is that they don't deal
    well with stairs that have a lip or no solid riser to push the wheel against.</p>

<h3>KR-II</h3>
<p>The Koryu-II or KR-II is a snake like robot developed by Shigeo Hirose. It
    consists of a series of 6 modules connected together. Each module has a single
    drive wheel on one side (the sides alternate, so that the thing can stand up).
    There is a sliding joint between sections to allow the relative heights of the
    sections to vary. There is also an actuator that sets the angle of the attachments
    (rotation around the &quot;z&quot; axis), and the wheel is always halfway between.
    This design was never intended for planetary exploration, but more as a firefighter/rescue
    worker adjunct, so it is modular, can go up and down stairs, etc. Obstacle surmounting
    is limited more by the vertical travel of the intersegment link than by the
    size of the wheel. It DOES require active control of everything. </p>

<h3>4 wheel rocker bogie NOMAD</h3>
<p>NOMAD is a big (725 kg) robot built by Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute to
    investigate planetary exploration methods. It made a semiautonomous traverse
    in the Atacama desert and subsequently was used in Antarctica to search for
    meteorites. NOMAD uses 4 wheels, all of which steer. The steering angles of
    the wheels on each side are linked. Each side has a giant rocker bogie, which
    is linked through a differential to the other side (forcing the body to be halfway
    between the sides). It can clear an obstacle of half the wheel size, so it has
    big diameter wheels (76cm diam). Overall, its appearance is reminiscent of the
    bottom of a &quot;snorkle-lift&quot;, which also has 4 wheel steering.</p>
