<h2>Robot Requirements</h2>
<p>This is a discussion of some generalized robot requirements for some applications 
  of interest (to me).</p>
<h3>Application 1 - Remote Exploration</h3>
<p>While exploring in person is interesting, there are times you wish that something 
  else could do some of the tedious footwork. Perhaps you are looking for artifacts 
  of some sort. Rather than spend a lot of hot dusty or damp rainy days trudging 
  around until you see something that looks interesting, you could control the 
  robot from the relative comfort of home.</p>
<p>I've driven enough robots around now to know that having an autonomous searcher 
  that automatically traverses an area in some systematic way is a pipe-dream. 
  You sort of have to count on a (at best) 1:1 ratio of &quot;operator controlling 
  time&quot; to &quot;robot operating time&quot;, although, you your controlling 
  time may not be simultaneous with the operating time. That is, the robot isn't 
  a time saver, per se. What it could do is save the time and resources getting 
  to and from a general area. For instance, one could spend an hour each day, 
  moving the robot forward a bit, picking strategic things to look at, etc. (This 
  is the generic Mars Rover scenario... Most folks don't realize that Sojurner's 
  top speed was 0.6 meters <i>per minute</i>. That's a blazing 1 cm/second, and 
  I dare you to move something by hand that slowly.)</p>
<ul>
  <li>The data link needs to support a sufficient rate to send command sequences, 
    and to get data and telemetry back.</li>
  <li>The robot needs sufficient mobility to traverse areas of interest. As a 
    working assumption, say it has to be able to go on any normal hiking trail. 
    What about crossing over/through a standard barbed wire fence?</li>
  <li>High resolution imaging (non real time) is necessary for mobility planning. 
    It might be nice to get multiple images from different angles/viewpoints.</li>
  <li>Some form of &quot;suicide avoidance&quot; should be implemented, so that 
    you don't drive over a hidden cliff, etc.</li>
  <li>The power source should be such that a fairly long duration operation can 
    be conducted (i.e. months). This would mean either fuel driven generators 
    or solar power, since I doubt that any practical form of storage battery would 
    work.</li>
  <li>Navigation is mostly outdoors, so GPS type navigation is probably sufficient 
    (especially with differential correction)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some locomotion alternatives are discussed <a href="loco.htm">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Application 2 - A toy to play with</h3>
<p>Driving a remote controlled vehicle is fun. It has to move fast enough to be 
  interesting, but not so fast that it's dangerous. The robot is controlled in 
  nearly real time, so the remote control link has to have sufficient bandwidth 
  to do this. The toy could also serve as a testbed for developing technologies 
  and algorithms for the more sophisticated exploration rover.</p>
<h3>Application 3 - Survey robot</h3>
<p>I've thought of this as a flying robot of some sort that can carry some sensor 
  package over some terrain. The sensor might be electromagnetic (ground pulse 
  radar) or imaging. For this, some form of autonomous scanning might actually 
  be useful and feasible.</p>
<p>Ideas: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Blimps - Tough to operate in any sort of wind, because the mass of the propulsion 
    system gets high, but BYU is working on a medium sized R/C blimp that might 
    be appropriate</li>
  <li>Powered Parachute - More portable. </li>
</ul>
