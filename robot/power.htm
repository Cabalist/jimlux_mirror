<h2>BucketBot Power Supply and Distribution</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Loads</h3>
<p>The DC power loads can be grouped as follows</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Traction Motors</dt>
    <dd> High peak currents (tens of amps), lots of switching noise on the bus from
        the PWM controllers
    </dd>
    <dt>Computers/Controllers</dt>
    <dd>Fairly low current (tens of mA) The current design uses a RabbitCore which
        draws very little power(&lt;1W), but if, in a future incarnation, I retrofit
        some form of laptop to the robot, a different power distribution and supply
        scheme might be necessary.
    </dd>
    <dt>Peripherals</dt>
    <dd> Some high currents, but switchable. Examples are power for the servos (hobby
        type) controlled by the SSC and the video camera.
    </dd>
    <dt>Radios</dt>
    <dd> Small current, except when high power is needed (transmitting video, for
        instance).
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Batteries</h3>
<p>Primary power is provided by a set of 12V 7AH high rate &quot;gel cells&quot;.
    These are the usual &quot;bricks&quot; that you see all over the place, and
    are a model designed for higher rate discharge (but not as high as the &quot;UPS
    duty&quot; ones that are designed to be discharged in 20 minutes).</p>
The original design (and current, as of 16 Nov) uses a pair of batteries, one
for each motor, because the Novak Electronic Speed controllers only run up to
12V, even though the motors are actually 24V motors. When the Vantec controller
is installed, the batteries will be rewired for 24V. At 12V, the speed of the
robot over the ground is quite manageable (less than 1m/sec), even at 100% duty
cycle, which is nice when letting the kids drive it.
<p>As I add the processor, more batteries will be added. Multiple batteries, although
    adding weight, have proven to be more reliable for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The power source for the traction motors (and, more importantly, the PWM
        controllers) tends to get a lot of switching noise, which wreaks havoc on
        the power for analog and low power digital circuitry.
    </li>
    <li>If the traction motor batteries go dead (or the fuse blows, etc.), you still
        have power for the processor and radios, so you can &quot;call for help&quot;.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>On Roger, I used some 24V DC/DC converters to generate isolated 5V power, but,
    the converters weren't very efficient (large unloaded static current draw) and
    they introduced noise of their own. I have some newer Vicor 24V to 5V DC/DC
    converters which are more efficient which I might try using.</p>
<p>The issue that hasn't been resolved yet is whether to use 4 batteries all told,
    2 for traction power, 1 for computers, and 1 for radios.</p>
<h3>Charging</h3>
<p>For now, I charge the batteries separately using an off the shelf external
    12V battery charger. It would be nice to have a single &quot;charging port&quot;,
    but that would require switching the traction batteries from series (24V) to
    parallel. A single DPDT switch (or relay) can do this (rearrange series to parallel).
    An even better solution might be a 3P- or 4PDT that switches all the batteries
    from &quot;use&quot; to &quot;charge&quot;, because the single DPDT scheme can
    potentially connect 24V to the 12V charger. Putting a diode in series to block
    reverse current will prevent the charger from working properly (because of the
    0.6V drop across the diode).</p>
