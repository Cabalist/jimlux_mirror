<h2>Total Solar Eclipses</h2>
<p>Go see one... really! Pictures cannot convey how impressive it really is. Furthermore, it gives you
    an excuse to travel to some exotic locale on a schedule that you can't change. None of this &quot;Well,
    work got a bit busy, so I'll just go next year&quot; stuff.&#160;</p>
<p>I've seen three: July 1991 in La Paz, Mexico (the best for centuries, 7 minutes
    of totality); November 1994 in Puerto Igauzu, Argentina (3+ minutes, but Iguazu
    Falls was worth the trip without the eclipse); and August 1999 in Salzburg Austria
    (about 2 minutes) </p>

<p>June 10, 2002 &quot;Partial Eclipse in Los Angeles&quot;</p>
<p>About 75% of the sun was covered on Monday afternoon, starting around 5:15
    PM PDT. I did finally get some decent pictures of the crescent sun image projected
    through the leaves of a tree.</p>

<p>August 11, 1999 &quot;Last Eclipse of the Century&quot;</p>
<p>We strategized where we would watch this one from, since the track crossed
    right through the middle of Europe. So many interesting places to go see! We
    settled on Salzburg Austria. <a href="eclipse99.htm">Read all about it and look
        at some pictures</a>.</p>

<p>July 11, 1991 &quot;Eclipse of the Century&quot;</p>
<p>This was notable because of its very long totality, over 7 minutes. This is from a combination of the
    sun being far away (and visually small) and the moon being close (and being visually big, so it
    obscures the sun longer). It was personally notable because it was the first total eclipse I have seen.
    I've written elsewhere that the antics of the eclipse chasers were almost as interesting as the eclipse,
    if not more so. A total eclipse is sort of interesting in an intellectual sense, but it is really more
    impressive in a visceral emotional sense. No words or pictures I have ever seen or heard can
    possibly convey the impact of the real thing. Now having done it, the words of the song about
    &quot;going to Nova Scotia to see a total eclipse of the sun&quot; have true meaning.</p>
<p>Here are some photos of the eclipse. Click on the thumbnails to see the bigger version. They're all
    about 30K or less in the large size. This was my first cut at scanning these images so a lot of the
    detail doesn't come through. They're also quite large on the screen, but compress quite nicely with
    JPEG (most of the image is black, after all).</p>

        <td style="width: 50%">A longer exposure showing corona detail. To the naked eye, the
            corona extended 4 or 5 diameters of the sun and was quite
            spectacular.

        <td style="width: 50%">During the partial phases, one of the more interesting phenomena
            is the projection of crescent sun images through pinholes and
            around edges. Here is a shadow of my hand with clearly visible
            crescents.
